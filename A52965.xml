         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:93855:3"/>the Life and Policies, the Riſe and Fortunes, Troubles and Exit of the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> whoſe great Actions, conſtant Loyalty, and ſucceſsful Councils, certainly are worthy the tranſmitting to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; for whoſe ſake, as well as the vindicating his Name and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the bold and confident, although ridiculous and groundleſs Calumnies wherewith the <hi>Roman Achitophels</hi> have maliciouſly aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. I have endeavour'd to Decipher him, and draw his Image according to the beſt of my skill, although infinitely below his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts; which juſtly merit the being pourtray'd by a more skilful hand; and one whoſe extraordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements, and admirable profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in Politicks, renders capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of repreſenting his Lordſhips wonderful Parts and Abilities, in the moſt apt and lively Touches.

            <p>
               <hi>My Lds.</hi> It was the extraordinary Endowments wherewith this Earl was inrich'd, that drew upon him ſo much Envy, and ſwell'd his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to ſuch an heighth of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Fury; fearing leſt he might prove their Rival, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a greater Intereſt in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Soveraign, then they were willing he ſhould. Or elſe it was his imitation of the magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous <hi>Roman,</hi> who being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Emperor to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear coming to the Senate, and threaten'd with Impriſonment if he preſumed to appear in that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, boldly anſwer'd, <hi>You may do as you will, but I muſt do as I ought.</hi> Nor had ever any Man
<pb facs="tcp:93855:4"/>larger Experience (then his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) of the truth and reality of what the famous Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> ſo long ſince wiſely obſerved, <hi>That he who follows Truth too near at the Heels, may have his Teeth ſtruch out thereby; and that he who goes after her, oft loſeth her ſight and himſelf too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſt Noble Patriots,</hi> I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it is no ſmall perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Illuſtrious Greatneſs, to be thus troubled with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Addreſs of one ſo much below you. And am very ſenſible, that the Generoſity and good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of perſons, who, like your ſelves, ſhine with Glory and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in a ſuperiour Orb, frequently draw upon them unneceſſary and needleſs Dedications. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhould not have been guilty of preſuming to ſix your Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Names to any trifle of mine,
<pb facs="tcp:93855:4"/>had not the nature of the thing laid a kind of neceſſity upon me, and furniſhed me with an unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Argument and ſufficient Apology for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it pleaſe your Lordſhips,</hi> You are all under the ſame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and you have (like him) adventur'd to ſtem the Stream, and dared to be Virtuous, when to be wicked and debauch'd is in Faſhion: And have preſumed to be Loyal, under the diſadvantage of expoſing your ſelves thereby to the malice and rage of a ſort of Men, who with an Helliſh Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry have long endeavour'd to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphiſe your very Virtues into Vices; and Tranſubſtantiate your Loyalty into a Crime. You have with a firm reſolution and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage, oppoſed in the very face of danger, the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and growing deſigns of a
<pb facs="tcp:93855:5"/>bloody and malicious Crew, who have <hi>Burned our City, Aſſaſſinated our Magiſtrates, Forged Shame Blots, and invented Meal-Tub Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to ruine our Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And if Divine Goodneſs had not protected us, and diſappointed them, would have murther'd our Soveraign, Maſſacred our Perſons, Extirpated our Religion, Plunder'd our Houſes, ſeized our Eſtates, trampled upon our Laws, inſlaved our Wives and Children, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected our Poſterity to a Bondage infinitely worſe then that of</hi> Egypt. And whatſoever is Sacred and Dear to us as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men or Chriſtians, muſt have been ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd to their Revenge; for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating whereof, and to give vent to their fury, they would have turn'd the Paradiſe of the World into an <hi>Acheldama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93855:5"/>
And moreover, <hi>my Lords,</hi> his Enemies are your Enemies, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches are all directed at and centre in You. You were all to be involved in the ſame Guilt, and made Parties in the ſame preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Conſpiracy. And You were by an imaginary Power (derived from that Infallible Fop the Pope) all condemned to the ſame Fate, in the ſecret Conſults and private Cabals of <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears by the Scheme found in the Meal-Tub, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more fully diſcovered by Mr. <hi>Dangerfield.</hi> Nor is it unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Your conſideration, that the time when that curſed Conſpiracy was hatching, and ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the management thereof, renders it not altogether improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it derived its Original from, and was ingaged in, upon the ſucceſs of a certain Story; upon the account whereof, the
<pb facs="tcp:93855:6"/>greateſt of You ſtands at this day ſtrip'd of all Your Honorary Places.</p>
            <p>But that which further encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd me to make this Addreſs to <hi>Your Lordſhips,</hi> was, Your being his intimate Acquaintance and conſtant Companions, his familiar Friends, and only Aſſociates, with whom he maintained an exact Correſpondence, and almoſt daily converſed withal; whereby You muſt neceſſarily be better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, and have a clearer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Principles and Temper, Deſigns and Inclinations of his Lordſhip, than any of his detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors can poſſibly pretend to: ſince many of them never had any perſonal knowledge of, and much leſs intimate Acquaintance with him; and moſt of them never ſaw him in their Lives. Nor have many of his Accuſers, notwithſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:93855:6"/>their formal and confident charging him with Treaſon, ever born a <hi>Part,</hi> or made a <hi>Figure large enough in the World to procure them admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to his Perſon, or imbolden them to appear in his preſence, or ſo much as exchange two words with him in their whole Lives.</hi> You know his Loyal Behaviour towards, and conſtant cleaving to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of his Soveraign; and are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Teſtimonies of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Reverence and profound Veneration wherewith he always made mention of His Majeſty, whenſoever you had occaſion to ſpeak of him in Your publick or private Diſcourſes; nor can You have forgotten his frequent lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own unhappineſs, in being ſo ſtrangely miſ-repreſented to His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>may it pleaſe Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi> as Heaven has been ſo
<pb facs="tcp:93855:7"/>propitious to the Earl to remove him far above the reach of his Enemies Fury, ſo I am firmly aſſured, that the ſame Almighty Power will always protect your Lives and Honours from the dire effects of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Policy, and all the Jeſuitical Crafts and ſubtle Artifices of the Antichriſtian Crew. And render the implacable malice of thoſe, whom all intelligent Men begin now to ſee are Your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without cauſe, unable to effect any thing to Your prejudice And make it ſerve only as a File to ſet off the Glory of Your Loyalty, or like an Eclipſe to the Sun, make the Luſtre of Your Innocence appear to the whole World with the more Brightneſs and Splendour; or at leaſt, enable You to take an extraordinary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſatisfaction in the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful contemplation, That Your
<pb facs="tcp:93855:7"/>Name, ſhall live when theirs are dead, and ſurvive with Honour, whilſt theirs with Infamy and Shame ſhall be buried in Oblivion; and that the remembrance of your Virtues ſhall be to all ſucceeding Ages, as Odoriferous as the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malick</hi> Spices, and the exhilera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Perfumes of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or the delightful fragrancy which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flows in the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> from a Garden of Roſes: When the remembrance of their wicked and treacherous Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes ſhall be nauſeous and offen. five to all Men.</p>
            <p>But the Fabrick being ſo ſmall, I muſt not ſuffer the entrance into it to exceed an equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; nor by enlarging my dull praiſes of the deceaſed Earl, injuriouſly detain <hi>your Lordſhips</hi> too long from the Harmony of his Actions; the Reviewing whereof
<pb facs="tcp:93855:8"/>afford abundantly more delight and ſatisfaction than any thing I am able to ſay in his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation can probably yield. And therefore (wiſhing your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips may long ſhine as Stars in our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hemiſphere, and in conjunction with our glorious Sun, ſend forth ſuch Illuſtrious Beams and powerful Rayes, as may effectually diſpel thoſe ſable Clouds which have ſo long over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread and darkened our Iſland) I commend Your Lordſhips to the protection of him that ſits in the Heavens, and laughs at the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chivilian</hi> Plots of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſees and derides all their ſubtile En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes; hoping he will graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly defend you from all impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dangers, by hiding you in the hollow of his Hand, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of his Wing. And humbly beg you would put

               <p>STate Policy is a kind of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Knowledge, which is by God and Nature locked up as a ſacred Jewel in a few very rare Cabinets, purpoſely framed and deſigned for that uſe by the all wiſe God, and is ſo eſſential to the peace and flouriſhing conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Nation that we ought to pay it all the reverence and veneration imaginable, and account it too ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

               <p>But as the beſt things converted into putrefaction, are the moſt nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous and hurtful, ſo this Noble and Angelical Science hath been ſtrangely abuſed by ſome ſordid pretenders to it. And every Age hath produced ſome <hi>Achitophels,</hi> who have abuſed the divine treaſure beſtowed upon them by the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> for the Service of their Country, and the promoting the Civil and Sacred Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Common-wealth wherein they live, by making it only ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viant to their baſe and wicked ends. Theſe are a ſort of men that have indeed the Wiſdom of the Serpent (but not a Dove-like innocency) and can, like him, clothe all their curſed Deſigns and Helliſh Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby they intend the ruin of their Prince, the Religion they pretend to own and practice, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the famous and flouriſhing Kingdom wherein they live (unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in nothing ſo much as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſuch unnatural and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Animals) with ſubtil and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretences of Loyalty, Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,

Nor had their Names ſwelled or looked ſo big in the Rolls of Fame. Whilſt the honeſt Politician is the <hi>Atlas</hi> of the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State, cures her when ſick, cements it when diſ-joynted, meets her in her ſeveral Emergencies with ſuitable reliefs: And like a skilful Pilate, manages the Helm with ſuch skill and dexterity, that he carries her ſafely through all perplexing intricaſies, and ſecures her in the Harbour of Peace and Tranquility, where ſhe Rides free from the danger of thoſe boiſterous Storms that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her Ruine.</p>
               <p>Such an one was <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> to <hi>Lewis</hi> 11. and <hi>Cromwell</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> 8. Such was <hi>Burleigh</hi> to our late Proteſtant Queen, whoſe ſedate Councils, like a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93855:11"/>ſacred Oracle, very much influenced the proſperity of her Raign; which was ſo extraordinary, that no Hiſtory affords a paralel: and future Ages will read her happy Annals with a Divine Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And ſuch an one was our paralel, the ingenious Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> to King <hi>James;</hi> for whom he did ſeveral emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent pieces of Service, as well in order to the bringing him to, and placing him upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Notwithſtanding which, he was ſo unhappy as to loſe the Favour of his Prince, and be abandoned, to the <hi>rage and malice of his Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſuch an one was the unparalell'd <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> whoſe Policy was always founded upon the ſolid Baſis of Piety and Judgment; upon which firm Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation he endeavour'd to raiſe the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſuperſtructure of Royal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Prince, free from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Arbitrary ſeverity, and a willing ſubjection in the People, without any kind of force or compunction; ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Intereſt of the Governour with that of the governed, and knitting both with ſuch reciprocal mixtures, that the welfare of the one might be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably involv'd in the good of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93855:11"/>other; That Majeſty might be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in its juſt Splendour, and the Royal Prerogatives of the Crown pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from ſuffering any kind of dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution: And yet the Liberty of the Subject remain, and Property be no way infringed or violated.</p>
               <p>In a word, his Wiſdom in contriving the peaceable Reſtoration of his Majeſty to his Crown and Kingdom, his ſagacity in Counſelling whilſt in that capacity, his Faithfulneſs in the diſcharge of places of Truſt, his exact Adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to his Fellow Subjects, his Loyalty and Obedience to his Majeſty at all times, his invincible Patience under the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies wherewith he was unjuſtly loaded. His Charity, Affability, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when it ſhall be conveyed by Hiſtory to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the following Ages, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him ſuch a juſt and deſerved Eſteem, that they will be ready to Adore him, and wonder at our ſtupidity; and make them with a diſdaining abhorrence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon our Folly, in ſlighting ſuch an ineſtimable Treaſure.</p>
               <p>This Great and Illuſtrious Peer was Nobly deſcended from the two Ancient Families of the <hi>Coopers</hi> and <hi>Aſhleys,</hi> being Son and Heir to Sir <hi>John Cooper</hi> of <hi>Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93855:12"/>in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> by <hi>Ann</hi> his Wife, Daughter and ſole Heir to Sir <hi>Anthony Aſhley</hi> of <hi>Wimborn St. Giles</hi> in the County of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> Knight and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet. For which reaſon he was call'd <hi>Anthony Aſhley Cooper,</hi> thereby to bear up the name of his Mothers Family as well as his Fathers; which would otherwiſe have been extinct. He was Born in the Month of <hi>July, Anno Dom.</hi> 1621. being the <hi>19th</hi> year of the Raign of King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At his Baptiſm his Mother deſir'd Sir <hi>Anthony Aſhly</hi> to ſtand for Godfather; which he willingly conſented to, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no more Children but that Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, named him <hi>Anthony Aſhley</hi> for the aforeſaid reaſon.</p>
               <p>Great care was taken in the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this young branch of Honour, who was to enjoy the Fountains, and maintain the Honour and Name of two ſuch Rich and Illuſtrious Families; his Father being worth about Eight Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> So that he was not raiſed from a mean Fortune, as ſome of his Adverſaries would malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly perſwade the World, but born to a large one. In his very Childhood his Activity, quick Apprehenſion, and ready
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93855:12"/>Wit, made an early diſcovery (even at that tender Age) of thoſe extraordinary parts wherewith God and Nature had ſo liberally enriched his capacious Soul. He had a natural inclination to Learning; wherein he made ſuch a ſurpriſing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that it was the wonder and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that knew him; and his Father, to encourage and improve thoſe pregnant Parts wherewith this happy Youth was bleſt, ſent him to the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and placed him in <hi>Trinity-Colledge,</hi> under the eare of an Ingenious and Learned Tutor: where neglecting all things that ſerved only for idle and vain ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and denying himſelf that Liberty which other Youths allowed themſelves for Recreation, he fell to thoſe Studies that were more uſeful and neceſſary, and tended to fit and prepare him for the ſerving his King and Country in any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment or capacity whatſoever; which he followed ſo hard, and made ſuch an unuſual progreſs therein, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incredible; ſo that every one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired him: and he was by all Men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the moſt prodigious Youth in the whole Univerſity. And thoſe who knew him, began to believe, that what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93855:13"/>had been predicted of him by a <hi>German</hi> Gentleman, might in time prove true.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman being a Proteſtant, and Perſecuted upon that account, left <hi>Germany,</hi> and fled to <hi>England</hi> for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; and falling by accident into the company of Sir <hi>John Cooper:</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi> being an Hoſpitable Gentleman, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe that were ſufferers upon the account of the True Religion, gave him an Invitation to his Houſe; which the Gentleman accepting, went accordingly: and was entertain'd by Sir <hi>John</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Reſpect and Generoſity for a conſiderable time. The Gentleman was extreamly pleaſed with his Entertainment in general; but was more eſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with that pleaſant and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Diverſion which the extraordinary Parts of his young Son afforded him. And would frequently (after having entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with various, difficult and intricate Diſcourſes, which required the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and profoundeſt Judgment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; wherein he always found him ſo ready and expert, that it exceeds all belief) ſay to Sir <hi>John,</hi> I can do no leſs than contemplate your Felicity in this Son, and almoſt envy you the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93855:13"/>He is certainly the Phoenix of his Age. I find him endow'd with ſuch a deep Judgment and capacious Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that I am confident, if he live to years of Maturity, he will be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt Politician, and the moſt prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Stateſ-man that ever this Nation did produce. But more eſpecially once directing himſelf to the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he ſpake to the effect following, as if guided thereto by ſome ſtrange and unaccountable impulſe; and if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the circumſtances of this Lords Life, it will appear to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick.</p>
               <p>Child, ſaid he, (as it was his cuſtom to call him) if thou wilt be Religious, and keep cloſe to God, and take care to avoid the vain and diſtractive allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Prophaneneſs and Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and entertain a fixed reſolution to improve all thy Parts and Abilities for the advancing the Proteſtant (and the prejudice of the <hi>Romiſh</hi>) Religion, you ſhall be a Man of the largeſt Parts in Chriſtendom, and ſhall be an inſtrument of doing an extraordinary piece of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to your Prince, which ſhall be very acceptable to him; whereupon you ſhall ſtand high in his Favour, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93855:14"/>to very great Honour: yet ſhould afterwards loſe the Princes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and be as much diſ-reſpected as before Honoured and Admired; yet at the ſame time you ſhall be one of the moſt Popular Men under Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that you may know that this will fall out according to my Prediction, pray remember this that I am now going to tell you, and Write it down in your Pocket-book, that you may not forget it. Not long after your coming from the Univerſity, you ſhall be in extream danger of Drowning; telling him the very day when it ſhould happen.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, although he gave no extraordinary credit to theſe Predictions, yet having a great Love and Veneration for the Gentleman, upon the account of his Piety and Wiſdom, he endeavoured to the uttermoſt of his power (as much as poſſible, to avoid the Watery Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>When he had ſpent ſome years at the Univerſity, he was removed from <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Colledge</hi> to <hi>Grays-Inn;</hi> where, with the like pains and induſtry, he applyed himſelf to the Study of the Law: in the knowledge whereof, he arrived at ſuch Perfection, that ſeveral Judicious Men
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93855:14"/>and great Lawyers did affirm, That he underſtood the nature of our <hi>Britanick.</hi> Laws and ancient Cuſtoms and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Kingdom, as well (if not better) than any Man living; and could expreſs himſelf with ſo much Eloquence, and deliver his Sentiments of things with ſo much clearneſs and ſmoothneſs, interwoven with ſuch convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, deduced from Philoſophy and Reaſon, that there was a perfect harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hy in his words.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was at <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to go with ſeveral young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of his Acquaintance to <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> by Water: but when he was upon the Stairs going to take Boat, (ſome of his company being already in the Boat) it came ſuddenly into his Mind, that that was the day whereof the Gentleman had foretold him; and pauſing a little, he remembred ſeveral circumſtances that confirm'd him therein: the Gentlemen who were in the Boat ſeeing him to ſtand in a ſtudy, and make no haſte into the Boat, they called to him to come away. Gentlemen, ſaid he, I intreat you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my going with you; for I now call to mind ſome extraordinary buſineſs, which obliges me to ſtay in Town. But
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93855:15"/>his company was too pleaſant to be ſo eaſily relinquiſh'd: wherefore one of them ſtepping out of the Boat, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by his importunity to alter his reſolution, and perſwade him to go with them according to his firſt intention; but being not able to prevail, he proteſted he would carry him into the Boat if he would not go willingly: ſo that being unwilling to diſoblige them, he adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to go, although with much relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy. As they were ſhooting the Bridge, it being low Water, the force of the Ebb carried their Boat with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt a Loyter that was juſt gone through before them, that ſhe ſunk; but ſeveral Boats preſently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king towards them, they were all ſav'd: however, their deſign for Bowling at <hi>Greenwich</hi> was ſpoiled for that day.</p>
               <p>Having ſpent ſome conſiderable time in the Inns of Court, his Relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think of diſpoſing of him in Marriage; and a ſuitable Match was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after, that might anſwer the largeneſs of his Fortune. At length a Marriage is agreed (by the conſent of both Families) between him and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> ſometime Lord Keeper of the Great
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93855:15"/>Seal of <hi>England:</hi> whoſe agreeable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation render'd his Life the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful. He had no Iſſue by this Wife.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Wife was the Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Exeter;</hi> by whom he had Iſſue his only Son and Heir, <hi>Anthony</hi> Lord <hi>Aſhly,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury;</hi> who married the virtuous and ingenious Lady, the Lady <hi>Dorothy,</hi> Daughter to <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Rutland;</hi> by whom he hath Iſſue two Sons; <hi>Anthony</hi> a Youth of about Twelve years of Age, extreamly like his Grandfather, both for Perſon and Parts; for which reaſon he was ſo dear to him, that his Life ſeemed to be bound up in this Grandſons, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> was ſaid to be in his Son <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>His laſt Wife was <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter to <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Spencer,</hi> a moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed and Virtuous Lady; whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Piety is ſo extraordinary, that ſhe may very well be propoſed as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for other Noble Perſonages to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; her conſtant cuſtom being to riſe by Five of the Clock in the Morning, and ſhe uſually ſpends two or three hours there in her private Devotions.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:93855:16"/>
               <p>No ſooner did the Fame of his great Abilities reach the Royal Ear, but his late Majeſty caſt a favourable Eye upon him, employing him in ſeveral eminent Services; which he performed with an exact Loyalty, to the ſatisfaction of his Majeſty; from whoſe Intereſt he never departed, otherwiſe then as <hi>Huſhai</hi> from King <hi>David,</hi> when the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> revolted from him, in order to the uſing his Intereſt for the Service of his Prince, and endeavour by his Wiſdom and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſo to order and influence the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Deſigns of the Conſpirators, that they might be the leſs hurtful to his Soveraign, and tend to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of themſelves. And it is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to contemplate with what dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Skill and exquiſite Policy he ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged all their Councils, as to make them run directly towards, and naturally tend to ſwell the Royal Stream; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon their Ebb, flowed ſo ſuddenly and ſwiftly, that like a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Sea, it eaſily overflowed all thoſe Banks which were caſt up to impede its Flux; and by its irreſiſtable force, bore down all before it, until at laſt it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the full Tide of his Majeſties Reſtoration. Like the Generous <hi>Huſhai,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:93855:16"/>never reſting until he ſaw his Ejected So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, like the glorious Sun, newly eſcaped from a total Eclipſe, return to the poſſeſſion of his Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty having <hi>December</hi> 5. 1639. upon the advice of the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and Marqueſs of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Land</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> declared his reſolution for the calling a Parliament. After 11 years interval, he was (by the unanimous conſent of the Inhabitants of the Borough of <hi>Tewkes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> in <hi>Glouceſter-ſhire,</hi> choſen to ſerve as Burgeſs for that Town; Sir <hi>Edward Alford</hi> being choſen for the other. On <hi>Monday April</hi> 13. 1640. this Parliament opened; and were acquainted by his Majeſty, That he thought never any King had greater cauſe to call his People together, nor more weighty Affairs to confer with them about, then himſelf: the particulars whereof he referred to the Lord Keeper: By whom they were recommended to the Parliament in an elegant Speech. The Parliament ſate in debate of thoſe things recommended to them till the fifth of <hi>May,</hi> when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty concluding they were too ſlow in giving thoſe Supplies he demanded, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93855:17"/>them, publiſhing a Declaration thereupon, containing an account of his Reaſons for that Diſſolution. This was the fourth Parliament which had been Diſſolved by his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of our unhappy Troubles, he raiſed a Regiment for the Service of his Majeſty; and was by him (upon the Rupture with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made Governour of <hi>Waymouth;</hi> being at the ſame time High Sheriff of the County of <hi>Dorſet:</hi> And when he ſaw that the War would unavoidably break out, he ſummoned (by virtue of his <hi>Peſſe Contitatus</hi>) the whole County from ſixteen years old, to meet at <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> which is the County Town, thereby to engage them to ſtand by his Majeſty: But before that day appointed for their Meeting, his Majeſty ſent down Colonel <hi>William Aſhburnham</hi> with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to be Governour of the County of <hi>Dorſet:</hi> whereupon he repaired pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and ſhewed his Commiſſion to the High Sheriff. At which time the Sheriff acquainted the Colonel with what he had done in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Majeſties Intereſt, by ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning the County: wherewith the Colonel was very well pleaſed. But Sir
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93855:17"/>
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> concluding that the Colonel's being ſent to command as Governour of the County, notwithſtanding his being Governour of <hi>Weymouth,</hi> and high She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of <hi>Dorſet-ſhire,</hi> proceeded from ſome ſecret ſuſpition which his Majeſty had conceiv'd of his Fidelity, (perhaps oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the malicious whiſperings of ſome about the King, who grew Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of him, leſt the greatneſs of his Parts ſhould in time have raiſed him higher in his Majeſties Favour and good Opinion, then would have conſiſted with their Intereſt) took Horſe the next Morning, and went to his own Houſe, about 20 Miles from thence; the next day he went to his Brothers, and from thence to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The day being come for the Counties Meeting, they flocked in vaſt numbers to <hi>Dorcheſter;</hi> there being ſcarce a Man in the whole County wanting: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Colonel (being informed that the High Sheriff was not in Town) went up to the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſeveral of the chief of the Town, and told the People, That he was glad to ſee ſo great an appearance; and that they yielded ſo ready Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Summons of their Sheriff,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93855:18"/>who was at that time abſent; telling them, that the occaſioning of Summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, was to engage them to his Majeſties Intereſt: asking them, If thoſe unhappy differences that were ariſen between the King and his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not be compoſed, but ſhould break out into a War, who they would ſtand by, his Majeſty or the Parliament. Whereupon they all cried out with one conſent, <hi>By the King, We will ſtand by the King againſt all Oppoſers whatſoever.</hi> Gentlemen, ſaid the Colonel, I thank you for this Declaration which you have now made of your Loyal Intentions; I hope your Hearts have gone with your Words therein: and that you will make good your Promiſes when his Majeſties Occaſions ſhall require it. Whereupon they were diſmiſt and ſent home.</p>
               <p>In <hi>October</hi> 1645. he was choſen She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> which choice was <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> the firſt, approved of and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Parliament. And the next year, 1646. he was choſen Sheriff of the County of <hi>Wilts;</hi> diſcharging the Offices both years with abundance of Candour and Generoſity. And in the year 1651. the Parliament out of a deep ſenſe of his profound Wiſdom, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93855:18"/>him, <hi>January</hi> 20. with twenty perſons more, to ſit as a Committee, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the inconveniencies which were in the Law, and the Miſchiefs which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ariſe from the Delays, and other Irregularities in the Adminiſtration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and ordered them to report their Opinion therein to the Houſe.</p>
               <p>Not long after this the Scene of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs alter'd, and <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Ambitious Deſigns for Uſurping the Supream Power being now ripe, he reſolved to put them into execution; and as the firſt Eſſay, took upon him to Diſſolve that rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of a Parliament. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, on the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1653. he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Houſe, attended by ſome of his principal Officers, and delivered ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Reaſons why they ought to be Diſſolved, and a period put to their Sitting; which was immediately done. The Speaker, with all the reſt of the Members, ſome through fear, and others by force, preſently departed the Houſe, all the Nation rejoycing thereat; and ſcarce any man grieved for their Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution but themſelves: every one affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that although probably the Nation could not be much better'd by this change, yet worſe could not poſſibly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93855:19"/>befall it. However <hi>Cromwell</hi> did not think it time as yet to take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abſolutely into his own hands; wherefore he ſummoned another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ſomewhat like the former, to which he gave the name of a Parliament.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, Sir <hi>A.</hi> being looked upon by his Country-men, as the fitteſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to oppoſe and baffle any extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant motions or deſigns that ſhould be propoſed to, or carried on by them, was returned to ſerve therein for his Native County of <hi>Wilts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Convention had ſeveral ſtrange things under debate, that would have been very dangerous and prejudicial to the Nation; and he acted the part of a Wiſe Politician, and a true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, in rendring their Debates ineffectual and to no purpoſe, as well by his ingenious Arguments drawn from Scripture and Reaſon, as the Intereſt he had in the Gentlemen of the Country; whereby he engaged them to appear alſo againſt the Deſigns which were then carrying on. Whereat the contrary Faction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrangely exaſperated, ſtormed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and puſhed forward their Deſigns with the greater fury. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the reſt (although the Majority)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93855:19"/>fearing to be undermin'd, by their laying hold of an opportunity to Aſſemble themſelves in their abſence, any Forty being a <hi>Quorum,</hi> and thereby accompliſh their Deſigns, reſolved to Diſſolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which they did accordingly: and ſo by that means quaſh'd thoſe miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Deſigns upon which they were Brooding.</p>
               <p>However, <hi>Cromwell</hi> reſolved, that whoever loſt, he would be no loſer by this Diſſolution; wherefore he (by a ſtrange way of Reaſoning) pretended, that by this means the whole Supream Power and Authority of the three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (both Civil and Military) was of courſe devolved into his hands; and thereupon called a Council of Officers to conſult about ſetling the Government: who after ſeveral Debates, reſolved to have a Commonwealth in a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; which Perſon ſhould be <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> by the name of Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Cromwell</hi> calls a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which met <hi>September</hi> 3. 1654. whereof Sir <hi>A.</hi> was choſen a Member, the Country ſuppoſing him to be the fitteſt Man they could chooſe to obviate and undermine <hi>Cromwells</hi> Tyrannical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93855:20"/>
                  <hi>Cromwell</hi> makes a Politick ſmooth Speech to them, endeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to embrace his Intereſt; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing (for their encouragement) to do ſtrange things for the good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they would but afford him their Aſſiſtance in order thereunto. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome of the Members were Men for his turn, and were reſolved to ſerve him in his ambitious Deſigns to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of their power, although them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Poſterity ſuffered for it, yet Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> and abundance of others, were too Wiſe to be impoſed upon, and too couragious to be hector'd into a compliance. So that being the Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they over-number'd thoſe who were for complying with the Uſurpers Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and render'd his hopes in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament vain and ineffectual. Whereat the Tyrant, being inraged to ſee his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations ſo fruſtrated, Diſſolved them; leſt if he had ſuffered them to ſit any longer, they might have overthrown his new acquired Uſurpations.</p>
               <p>But the Protector being extreamly neceſſitated for Money, and having a longing deſire to have his Power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to him by the conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hoping that a ſecond Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93855:20"/>would grant him that which the firſt refuſed, Iſſues out his Writs for the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of another Parliament. Yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the Speeches and Carriage of Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> and ſome other Members of the late Parliament, he gave ſecret di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to the Sheriffs of the ſeveral Counties, to uſe their utmoſt endeavour to prevent (if poſſible) their being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, or returned to ſerve in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. However, the Countries ſtriving to pleaſe themſelves rather then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector; and preferring their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt before <hi>Cromwells,</hi> Returned Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> and moſt of the other Members that oppoſed the Protectors Deſigns in the late Parliament, to ſerve in this: whereby this Stratagem failed of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing its deſired effects; which forced him to take new Meaſures, and invent the following Shifts, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That every Member before he was to ſit in the Houſe, was impoſed upon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly to engage himſelf by promiſe, not to act any thing prejudicial to the preſent Government. But fearing leſt this device ſhould not keep out enough to make the Parliament pliable and fit for his purpoſe, he gave ſpecial directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not to admit of any into the Houſe,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93855:21"/>but thoſe only that produced a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or Warrant in the following form.</p>

                  <hi>September</hi> 17. 1656. being the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Meeting of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he went to the Parliament Houſe at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> expecting to Sit there as a Member of that Parliament: But found Entrance not only denied to himſelf, but to above an Hundred more, who had been Members of the former Parliament, and had render'd themſelves obnoxious to the Uſurper, by Oppoſing and Acting in contradiction to his Deſigns of Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing his Tyranny: They being all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93855:21"/>Excluded for want of the aforeſaid Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate or Warrant. Whereupon (after having conſulted together) they applied themſelves for Redreſs to that part of the Parliament which was admitted to Sit. Acquainting them by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that above an Hundred of the Members which were choſen by the Country, and ſent up to ſerve in the Parliament, were not able to obtain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into the Houſe, being kept out by order of the Protector. But thoſe within the Houſe, being all of them <hi>Cromwells</hi> Creatures, upon the Queſtions being put, Reſolved, That thoſe perſons ought to make their Application to the Council for Acceptance and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, finding that they could obtain no relief againſt thoſe Arbitrary and Illegal Practices of the Uſurper, they unanimouſly conſented to draw up and publiſh a Remonſtrance, wherein they claimed the priviledge of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fundamental Laws, and their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right as Free-men of <hi>England.</hi> But the Remonſtrance being much too large to be here inſerted, I ſhall only preſent you with one or two Paragraphs, as a Specimen of thoſe brave <hi>Heroes</hi> Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93855:22"/>againſt a <hi>Protectorian</hi> Invaſion: And the greatneſs of their Courage, and brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gallantry, will be the more conſpicuous, if we conſider this was done when the then Protector was in his <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith;</hi> when he had made almoſt all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> tremble before him, ahd gave Laws to his Neighbouring Princes; and held that Thunder in his Fiſt, wherewith he ſhook the Nation off her very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations: And the Houſe too filled with thoſe who either were, or ſeemed to be his Creatures: Yet in a general Defiance of this ſo Potent a Conquerour, did thoſe Noble Patriots (amongſt other things) Remonſtrate.</p>
               <p>When our Worthy Anceſtors have been met in Parliaments, and have found Oppreſſion and Tyranny ſupported by ſuch ſtrong hands, that they could not prevail to ſecure their Countries, Lives and Liberties by wholſome Laws, they have often made their Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt Injuſtice and Oppreſſion; and forewarned the People of their danger. In like manner, we who have been duly choſen by the People to be Members of the Parliament, that ſhould now have met, and have an undoubted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93855:22"/>Right to meet, Sit, and Vote in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, although we are Oppreſſed by Force of Arms, and ſhut out of the uſual place of Parliament Sitting; yet having Hearts ſenſible of that higheſt Truſt repoſed in us, and being filled with Cares for the <hi>Church</hi> and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which with grief of heart we behold bleeding; we do hold our ſelves bound in duty to God, and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to declare unto the People of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> their and our woful condition, and the moſt evident danger of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Subverſion of Religion, Liberty, Right, and Property.</p>
               <p>We believe the Rumour is now gone through the Nation, that Armed Men, employed by the L. P. have prevented the free Meeting and Sitting of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Parliament, and have forcibly ſhut out of doors ſuch Members as he and his Council ſuppoſed would not be frighted or flattered to betray their Country, and give up their Religion, Lives, and Eſtates to be at his Will, to ſelve his Lawleſs Ambition. But we fear that the Slavery, Rapines, Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Cruelties, Murthers, and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that are comprehended in this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Fact, are not ſo ſenſibly diſcerned,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93855:23"/>or ſo much laid to heart as the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; and we doubt not, but as the common practice of the Man hath been, the Name of God, and Religion, and formal Faſts and Prayers will be made uſe of to colour over the Blackneſs of the Fact: We do therefore in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God and our Country, hereby Remonſtrate;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That whereas by the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws of this Nation, the People ought not to be bound by any Laws, but ſuch as are freely conſented unto by their choſen Deputies in Parliament, and it is a moſt wicked Uſurpation, even againſt the very Laws of Nature, for any man to impoſe his <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon another as a Rule, unleſs there be ſome compact or Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parties for that intent. And whereas by the Mercy of God only, in preſerving this Fundamental Law and Liberty, the good People of <hi>England</hi> have beyond memory of any Record, preſerved their Eſtates, Families, and Lives, which had otherwiſe been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed at the will of every wicked Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and by keeping this only as their undoubted Right, they have been kept from being brutiſh Slaves to the luſts of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93855:23"/>their Kings, who would otherwiſe have deſpoiled them of their Perſons, Lives, and Eſtates by their Proclamations, and the Orders of themſelves and their Council. Now the <hi>L. P.</hi> hath by force of Arms invaded this Fundamental Right and Liberty, and violently prevented the meeting of the peoples choſen De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties in Parliament; and he and his Council boldly declare;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That none of the Peoples Deputies ſhall meet in Parliament, unleſs they agree to the meaſure of their Fantaſies, Humours and Luſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They now render the people ſuch Fools, or Beaſts, as know not who are fit to be truſted by them with their Lives, Eſtates and Families: But he and his Council, that daily devour their Eſtates, and Liberties, will judge who are fit to counſel and adviſe about Laws to preſerve their Eſtates and Liberties. Thus doth he now openly aſſume a power to pack an Aſſembly of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents, Paraſites, and Confederates, and to call them a Parliament, that he may from thence pretend that the <hi>People</hi> have conſented to become his Slaves, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93855:24"/>to have their perſons and Eſtates at his Diſeretion. And if the people ſhall tamely ſubmit to ſuch a <hi>Power,</hi> who can doubt but he may pack ſuch a Number as will obey all his Commands, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his taking what part of our Eſtates he pleaſeth, and to impoſe what Yoaks he thinks fit to make us draw in.</p>
               <p>They know it to be the undoubted Right of the <hi>People</hi> to truſt whom they think fit, and as much the Right of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man duly choſen and truſted, to meet and Vote in Parliament, without asking their leave, or begging their Tickets. And although there have been frequent Secret Deſigns for many years to ſubvert Religion, Liberty, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in this Nation; and to that end the Deſigns of Tyranny have attempted to deſtroy ſometimes the <hi>Being,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Power, Priviledges,</hi> and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Parliaments; yet the Mercy of God hath almoſt miraculouſly preſerved the Being, Priviledges and Authority of Parliaments, and therein Religion, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Property, until the time of the Lord Protector.</p>
               <p>But now he hath aſſumed an abſolute Arbitrary Soveraignty (as if he came
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93855:24"/>down from the Throne of God) to create to himſelf, and his Confederates, ſuch Powers and Authorities, as muſt not be under the cognizance of the Peoples Parliaments. His Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he declares ſhall be binding Laws to Parliaments themſelves; he takes upon him to be above the whole Body, and every Member of it, by no other Rule or Law than his pleaſure, as if he were their Abſolute Lord, and had bought all the People of <hi>England</hi> for his Slaves. Doubtleſs he would pretend only to have Conquered <hi>England</hi> at his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; and, were there as much Truth as there is Falſhood in that pretence, yet he could not but know that the Right of the Peoples Deputies to their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Powers and Priviledges would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main good againſt him, as againſt their publick capital Enemy. Whom every man ought to deſtroy, until by ſome agreement with the Body of the People in Parliament, ſome ſort of governing Power in him were ſubmitted unto, that hereby he might ceaſe to be a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemy and Deſtroyer, and become a King, or Governour, according to the conditions accepted by the People; and if he would ſo pretend, he could
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93855:25"/>not be ſo diſcharged from his publick Enmity by any Condition or Agreement made with a part of the Peoples choſen Deputies, whilſt he ſhut out the other part; for no part of the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives Body are truſted to conſent to any thing in the Nations behalf, if the whole have not their free Liberty of Debating and Voting in the Matters propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>If he would pretend no higher than to be our Conquerour, who for Peace and his own ſafeties ſake, was content to ceaſe from being a publick Enemy, and to be admitted a Governour, he would not compaſs thoſe ends by forcibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding (as now he does) whom he pleaſes of the Repreſentative Body of People, who were to ſubmit to him on the Peoples behalf; therefore he either takes upon him to be ſuch a Conqueror as ſcorris the Peoples acceptance of him by their Repreſentative as their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and fears not to remain a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemy, or elſe he takes himſelf to be ſuch an unheard of Soveraign, that againſt him the People have no claim of Property or Right in themſelves, or any thing elſe; for he hath now declared, that the Peoples choice cannot give any
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93855:25"/>man a Right to ſit in Parliament, but the Right muſt be derived from his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Will and Pleaſure, with that of his Councellors, and his Clerks Ticket only muſt be their evidence for it.</p>
               <p>Thus hath he exalted himſelf to a Throne like unto God's, as if he were of himſelf, and his power from himſelf, and we were all made for him, to be commanded and diſpoſed of by him, to work for him, and ſerve his Pleaſure and Ambition.</p>
               <p>A little after there is an Inſtance of Chief-Juſtice <hi>Treſilian,</hi> who was executed at <hi>Tyburn</hi> in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, for adviſing the King, that he might at any time diſſolve the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and command the Members to depart under the penalty of Treaſon. Divers other Proteſtations were contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Inſtrument againſt the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarineſs and Tyranny of that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in concluſion they declare they will pour out their complaints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord againſt their powerful Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, hoping he will redeem his People out of the hands of wicked and deceitful Men. This Proteſtation was Signed by One hundred and ſeventeen perſons, whereof Sir <hi>Anthony Aſhley
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93855:26"/>Cooper</hi> was chief, and many others of great Loyalty and Integrity, ſome whereof are ſince dead, but many yet ſurvive; and as a reward of their Loyalty, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Places of Honour and Profit under his preſent Majeſty.</p>
               <p>By this we may eaſily diſcern the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he had of the Illegal and Arbitrary proceedings of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and how much of the ſufferings of the Loyal Party would have been prevented, had that point of a free Parliament been then gained: and conſequently His Majeſties Reſtauration muſt have happened ſooner than it did. This Remonſtrance had not power enough however to work their preſent admiſſion into the Houſe, ſo that that part of a Parliament which was ſuffered to ſit, did every thing to the deſire of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> anſwering both thoſe ends for which they were Convened, <hi>viz.</hi> the raiſing Money, and confirming his Title; which was no ſooner done, but he Prorogued them until he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to Fleece them again; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval was laid hold on by this true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman as a fit opportunity to engage them, when they met again, to do themſelves and the Nation Juſtice, by admitting him and the reſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93855:26"/>that were kept out by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, to take their place in Parliament; and ſo managed ſome of the Members, who were moderate men, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to be ſo baſely trampled on by the Tyrant any longer.</p>
               <p>The Prorogation being expired, the Parliament make their appearance at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where the Protector makes a fair Speech to them, promiſing them ſtrange things if they would go on and proſecute his Deſigns. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Speech, the Commons were no ſooner retired to their Houſe, than <hi>Cromwell</hi> diſcovered to his no ſmall perplexity, that the Face of his beloved Parliament, from whoſe tractableneſs and compliance he had promiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the greateſt happineſs imaginable, was ſtrangely altered: For they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell to Voting, That no Member le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally Choſen and Returned, could be excluded from performing their Duty, but by conſent of Parliament; and thereupon immediately proceeded to the calling over their Houſe, and admitted Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> and the reſt, who had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Remonſtrance (to the no good liking of the Protector) who were no ſooner in, and the Houſe full, but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93855:27"/>they ſo influenced the reſt, that they ſoon became the majority, and began to undo what the others had done in their abſence; and preſumed ſo far as to queſtion the Tyrants Power. Wherefore finding them ſo bold, he concluded it would not be convenient to let a buſineſs of ſo high a nature run too far, leſt it ſhould, if neglected, put a period to all his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Deſigns. Wherefore going to his Pageant Houſe of Lords, he ſent for them, and after having made a large Speech to them, in the concluſion told them, That it did concern his Intereſt, as well as the publick Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of the Nation, to terminate that Parliament, and therefore he did then diſſolve them, and put an end to their Sitting.</p>
               <p>The conſtant correſpondence he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies maintained with the Royal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that almoſt to the hazard of his Life and Family, are ſufficient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of his ſincerity to his Maſters Intereſt and Service; his Houſe was a Sanctuary for diſtreſſed Royaliſts, and his correſpondence with the Kings Friends (though cloſely managed, as the neceſſities of thoſe times required) are not unknown to thoſe that were the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93855:27"/>principal managers of his Majeſties Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at that time. This made <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſo apprehenſive of this great Aſſertor of his Countries Rights, and Oppoſer of Arbitrary Government and Enthuſiaſm, that though his vaſt Abilities were known (at leaſt) to equal the ableſt Pilot of the State, which was the only motive that induced the Uſurper, in the infancy of his Uſurpation, to nominate him for one of his Council, in hope thereby to allure him to his Intereſt, and wheadle and Wire-draw him into a compliance with his ambitious and miſchievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; yet we cannot find him amongſt the Creatures of his Cabinet Council, nor amongſt the Eleven Major Generals, to whom the Care of the Nation was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: No, their Principles, their Aims and Deſigns were incompatible; one was for Subverting, the other for Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Antient ſtanding Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of the Nation; which once diſſolved, it was impoſſible but an Univerſal Deluge of Confuſion, Blood and Rapine muſt enſue. This made our brave Patriot (with divers of the Heroick <hi>Engliſh</hi> Race) to the utmoſt oppoſe the growth of a <hi>Protectorian</hi> Tyranny.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:93855:28"/>
And when the Rump had again uſurped the Power into their hands, they endeavoured to oblige him by nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to be one of their Council of State, and one of the Commiſſioners for the managing their Army. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, he continued his Intelligence with, and Endeavours for the Reſtoration of his Soveraign. So that we find him accuſed before them for keeping Intelligence with the King, and for having raiſed Men to joyn with Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> in attempting to reſtore and bring His Majeſty that now is to his Rightful Throne. Many perſons of great note were impriſoned on the account of this Plot; and amongſt the reſt Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Aſhly Cooper,</hi> who was really guilty (if there could be any Guilt in Loyalty, and an honeſt endeavour to free his Country from thoſe deplorable miſeries under which it then groaned) for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was a principal contriver of the Buſineſs, being one of the ſecret Cabal; and had always kept Intelligence with Sir <hi>George;</hi> and had raiſed a party in <hi>Dorſet-ſhire</hi> to joyn with him, which upon the miſcarrying of the Deſign, timely diſperſed themſelves: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no man knew better then he how
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93855:28"/>to obviate the Reaſons of the Houſe, and plead his own Cauſe, yet he was not without great difficulty cleared and diſcharged of that Imputation by the Rump; who ſhortly after intruſted him with the Cuſtody of the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Command of a Regiment of Horſe; and gave him (with ſix others to aſſiſt him) the Government and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Army.</p>
               <p>So that now he began to advance the great work of Reſtoring his Majeſty, with more ſucceſs and ſpeed than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. To which end he (and Eight more who had been of the Old Council of State) ſent a Letter to General <hi>Monke,</hi> to proceed in his generous Undertakings for the advantage and ſettlement of the three Nations; and perſwaded him to come to <hi>London,</hi> in order to the better proſecuting what he had ſo well begun. Whereupon the General (having diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ordered all things according to his deſire) advanced towards <hi>England,</hi> accompanied with ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who held correſpondence with him; and being acquainted with the Generals Deſigns, went thither on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to accompany him hither: where he was no ſooner arrived, but he was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93855:29"/>highly Honoured and Complemented by the Rump, and made one of the Council who was to order and diſpoſe of publick Affairs: but to qualifie them for this Truſt, they were to have an Oath impoſed upon them, wherein they were to abjure the Royal Family. But that being directly contrary to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Deſigns of thoſe two Noble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots of the Royal Cauſe, and bold Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers for the Intereſt of their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Soveraign; the one by his Head to contrive, and the other by his Arms to execute what was contrived, as well as aſſiſt in Counſelling and Adviſing; They oppoſed it as unreaſonable, and a Snare to their Conſciences; and by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon Colonel <hi>Morly,</hi> procured it to be ſo warmly oppoſed, that both Oath and Council fell, and came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Clarges</hi> having happily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that <hi>Lambert</hi> and others, were making parties, and drawing Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to oppoſe their Loyal Deſigns, repaired immediately to Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting him the fitteſt perſon to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a buſineſs of that nature (being not only firm to the Kings Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, but by his Wiſdom and Policy
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93855:29"/>knew how to undermine thoſe who were averſe to it) wherefore having related the particulars to him, deſiring him to communicate it to the Council, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them to take ſpeedy care about it, leſt if neglected, it ſhould prove of dangerous conſequence. Which he did accordingly, and ſo managed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that timely care was taken in it; and even that attempt of <hi>Lamberts,</hi> which in it ſelf threatened the contrary, was by his Skill, dexterouſly managed for the advantage of his Majeſties Intereſt, and the haſtening his happy Reſtoration.</p>
               <p>General <hi>Monke</hi> having forced the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to admit the ſecluded Members, they were no ſooner ſeated in the Houſe, but they fell to ſuch kind of work, as plainly diſcovered to all intelligent Men, what would be the Iſſue of thoſe things which were then tranſacted: for they ordered the Releaſe of all thoſe who were Impriſoned for Petitioning for a Free Parliament, together with the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Common-Council of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> They inlarged the Generals Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, conſtituting him one of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals at Sea. Diſcharged Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> and others, committed upon the account of his Riſing; and ordered the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93855:30"/>Examination of him and his Lady to be taken off the File, and given to them. Then having appointed a free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to meet in the <hi>April</hi> following, they Diſſolved themſelves; appointing a Council of State to govern in the mean while, conſiſting for the moſt part of Loyal Gentlemen; whoſe Names were as follows: <hi>Arthur Anſley</hi> Lord Preſident, <hi>William Pierpoynt, John Crew, Richard Knightly,</hi> Colonel <hi>Popham,</hi> Colonel <hi>Morley,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Aſhley Cooper,</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerard,</hi> Lord <hi>St. John,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Widdrington,</hi> Sir <hi>John Evelin,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Onſlow,</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant <hi>Maynard,</hi> Sir <hi>William Lewis,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Montague,</hi> Colonel <hi>Hanly,</hi> Colonel <hi>Norton, Denzill Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>John Temple,</hi> Colonel <hi>Tompſon,</hi> Sir <hi>John Trever,</hi> Sir <hi>John Holland,</hi> Sir <hi>John Poltis,</hi> Colonel <hi>Birch,</hi> Sir <hi>Harbottle Grimſton, John Swinton, John Weaver,</hi> Colonel <hi>Roſſiter,</hi> Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Lord General <hi>Monke.</hi> This Council was ſo influenc'd by the two great Contrivers and Managers of the happy change, that everything done by them tended to the furthering thereof.</p>
               <p>And <hi>April</hi> 25. 1660. the new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament met in both Houſes; which was the moſt conſiderable ſtep they had yet
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93855:30"/>made towards the accompliſhing their great End; and gave an entrance to, and made way for the perfecting the whole Contrivance. For His Majeſty immediately hereupon, diſpatcht away Sir <hi>John Greenvil</hi> (who was afterwards created Earl of <hi>Bath</hi>) with Letters to both Houſes of Parliament, and General <hi>Monke;</hi> which were delivered to them upon the firſt day of <hi>May,</hi> (being but the ſeventh day after the opening of the Parliament) together with his Majeſties gracious Declaration to all his Loving Subjects. Wherein he expreſſes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of compaſſion and tenderneſs to the Nation; which had been ſo long harraſs'd by an unnatural War.</p>
               <p>Theſe Letters, and the Declaration, were received by the Parliament with a Joy and Veneration ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that I find my ſelf at a loſs for words wherewith to expreſs it. And their pleaſure and ſatisfaction was ſuch, that in an extaſie of Joy, they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly drew the Curtain, and expoſed the Beautiful and Glorious Scene to the delightful view of the languiſhing Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators; wherein they plainly law the happy Iſſue of thoſe Policies and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils that were before Riddles too myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93855:31"/>for vulgar underſtandings to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, or once imagine whither they tended, or where they would termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, by the following Reſolves of both Houſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved by the Houſe of Peers, That they do own and declare, That according to the Ancient and Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, the Government is, and ought to be, by King, Lords, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved, That a Committee of Eight Lords do joyn with a Committee of the Houſe of Commons, to conſider of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to His Majeſties gracious Letter and Declaration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved by the Houſe of Commons, That a Committee be appointed to prepare an Anſwer to His Majeſties Letter, expreſſing the Great and Joyfid ſenſe of this Houſe for his Gracious Offers, and their humble and hearty Thanks to His Majeſty for the ſame; and with profeſſions of their Loyalty and Duty to His Majeſty: And that this Houſe will give a ſpeedy Anſwer to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Gracious Propoſals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:93855:31"/>
                  <hi>Reſolved, That the ſum of</hi> 50000 1. <hi>be Preſented His Majeſty from this Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The receiving thoſe Letters, and the Parliaments compliance therewith, was no ſooner reported to the City, but the Citizens were almoſt overwhelmed with Joy; the harmony of the Bells, and the flaming Piles which inlightened every Street, ſurrounded with incredible Shouts and Acclamations of Joy, were ſufficient demonſtrations of the infinite pleaſure and ſatisfaction they took in this no leſs wonderful then happy Revolution; and the ſeveral Counties taking the Alarm from <hi>London,</hi> contended which ſhould out-vie each other in expreſſions of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Joy.</p>
               <p>Then the Parliament proceeded to draw up a Letter in Anſwer to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſubſcribing it to the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty, deſiring him ſpeedily to return to the Exerciſes of his Kingly Office; appointing Commiſſioners to go over to <hi>Holland,</hi> and attend His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty during the remainder of his ſtay there, and in his return to <hi>England.</hi> Of theſe Commiſſioners, there were ſix for the Houſe of Lords; for the Houſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93855:32"/>of Commons Twelve, whereof our great Patriot was one; and Twenty for the City of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Inſtructions being delivered to the Commiſſioners, they ſet Sail for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in ſeveral Frigats, appointed by the Parliament to attend them; and after ſome danger by bad Weather, they Landed at the <hi>Hague,</hi> whither His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was then removed from <hi>Breda,</hi> (where he had reſided ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) as being a place nearer and more convenient for his Shipping; the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal whereof, and of the whole Fleet, was remitted to His Majeſties pleaſure, General <hi>Montague</hi> having received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the Parliament to Obey His Majeſties Orders and Directions therein. The Commiſſioners were no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived but they went and waited on His Majeſty, and with all imaginable Reſpect and Veneration, delivered their reſpective Meſſages, and behaved themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Inſtructions they received from their Principals: beſeeching His Majeſty in the name of his Parliament and People to return and re-aſſume the Scepter, aſſuring him, That he ſhould be infinitely welcome without any terms. They were received by his Majeſty with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93855:32"/>a Port and Grace like himſelf, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd with extraordinary Favour and Magnificence.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Parliament Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd the King; which was perform'd with all the Joy, Splendour and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, that Love or Loyalty could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire. The chief Lords of the Houſe of Peers, and the moſt eminent of the Houſe of Commons, the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, together with the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, all in their Coaches, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the whole Militia of the City; waited upon, and aſſiſted in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and the Shouts and Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the crouding Multitudes, was ſo extraordinary, that although all the Bells throughout the City and Suburbs were at that time Ringing, yet their noiſe was not to be heard.</p>
               <p>The King preparing for his Return, was magniſicently Treated by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and highly Complimented by all the Forraign Ambaſſadours. And the <hi>Dutch,</hi> knowing that they ſhould thereby very much pleaſe the King, enlarg'd their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities to our great Patriot, and the reſt of the Commiſſioners from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and City, treating them by their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93855:33"/>Deputies, to their great content and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>Whilſt this great Adventurer for the Royal Cauſe continued in <hi>Holland,</hi> one day as he was doing his Duty in waiting on his Soveraign, had the unhappineſs to be overthrown in a Carravan, whereby he received an unfortunate Wound in his ſide between the Ribs; which in time came to an Exulceration; and was in the year 1672. when he was Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, forc'd to be opened: The Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was performed by Mr. <hi>Knolls</hi> the Chyrurgeon, by the Advice and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the famous Doctor <hi>Willis;</hi> and ſuppoſed to be the greateſt Cure that ever was done upon the Body of Man: From whence we may learn, the hard Fate which ſometimes attend the moſt commendable Actions, ſince this (which was the greateſt mark and enſign of Loyalty) ſhould be made the matter of the greateſt Obloquy and Reproach; moſt of thoſe malicious Pamphlets that have been written againſt him, being filled with Invectives, grounded upon the Story of the Tap. Oh monſtrous Ingratitude!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:93855:33"/>
His Majeſty having prepared all things in readineſs, Embarqued for <hi>England,</hi> the Royal <hi>Charles</hi> being appointed for that purpoſe: And was attended by the Commiſſioners, and a numerous Company of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentry, and waited on by General <hi>Mountague</hi> with the whole Fleet; and having a fair and gentle Gale, Landed at <hi>Dover May</hi> 25. where he was met by the General and chief Nobility, and ſo conducted to <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Rocheſter,</hi> and <hi>Darkford,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London;</hi> where His Majeſty found the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, ready in a Tent which was pitcht in St. <hi>Georges Fields</hi> to receive him; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Regiments being there placed in Order, made a Lane for his Majeſty to paſs through, the Sword being delivered him, according to Cuſtom he re-deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it, and after a ſplendid Treat, proceeded into <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Southwark,</hi> from the <hi>Bridge</hi> to <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> the Streets were Railed; on one ſide with Standings for the Liveries; and on the other with the Train'd Bands, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal Companies of Gentlemen Volunteers in White Doublets, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sir <hi>John Staywell,</hi> through

               <p>The <hi>Friday</hi> following His Majeſty went the private way to the Houſe of Lords; and after having made a ſhort Speech, ſigned thoſe Acts which were ready for the Royal Aſſent. And not long after, proceeded to the choice of his Privy-Council; and in conſideration of the great Eſteem he had for Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Aſhly Cooper,</hi> nominated him for one of them; Wiſely conſidering, That he whoſe Counſels had been ſo ſucceſsful in contriving His Reſtoration, might be highly neceſſary, and very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Eſtabliſhment of Him in His Kingdom; and to ſhew the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Eſteem he had for his Parts and Abilities, he advanced him to be one of

And when his Majeſty was pleaſed to iſſue out the Grand Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> for the Trial of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, directed to ſeveral Noble Perſons, choice was made of this Honourable Lord to be of the number of that Court, his Majeſty deeming him to be a Perſon whoſe Prudence and Loyalty render'd him as deſerving of the Honour to which his Majeſty therein preferred him, as any other contained in that Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>And as if his Majeſty had ſo high a Valuation for his Lordſhip, that he thought his profound Parts and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Loyalty merited a perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Royal Favours, he raiſed him at ſeveral times to higher degrees of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, making him Chancellor of his Exchequer, Under-Treaſurer of the Exchequer, Lord Lieutenant of the County of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and one of the Lord Commiſſioners of the Treaſury.

He was advanced to the Title and Dignity of an Earl, being in the year 1672. created Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and Lord <hi>Cooper</hi> of <hi>Paulet,</hi> to him and the Heirs Males of his Body; by Letters Patents bearing date at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 23<hi>d.</hi> day of <hi>April,</hi> in the Twenty Fourth Year of his Majeſties Raign.

Whereby he was placed by his Great Maſter, in the higheſt Orb that any Subject could poſſibly move in. The Kings Conſcience being as it were, committed to his Care and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement. And with what Prudence and Candour, Honour and Integrity, he acquitted himſelf in that great and weighty Imployment, the Tranſactions of the Court of Chancery during the

The King and His <hi>Miniſters</hi> had here a hard time, and lay every day under new <hi>Obloquies.</hi> Sometimes they were repreſented as <hi>ſelling</hi> all to <hi>France</hi> to make this <hi>War: Portſmouth, Plymouth,</hi> and <hi>Hull,</hi> were to be given into the <hi>French</hi> hands for Caution. The next day news came, that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were agreed. Then the <hi>obloquy</hi> was turned from <hi>treachery</hi> to <hi>folly:</hi> The Miniſters were now <hi>Fools,</hi> that ſome days before were <hi>Villains.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Coffee-houſes</hi> were not to be blamed for their laſt apprehenſions; ſince if that <hi>Conjunction</hi> had taken effect, then <hi>England</hi> had been in a far worſe caſe then now it is, and the War had been turned upon us. But <hi>both Kings</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Intereſts, reſolved to Joyn againſt them, who were the Common Enemies to all <hi>Monarchies,</hi> and I may ſay, eſpecially to ours, their only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor for <hi>Trade,</hi> and Power at Sea; and who only ſtand in their way to an <hi>univerſal Empire,</hi> as great as <hi>Rome.</hi> This the States underſtood ſo well, and had ſwallowed ſo deep, that under all their preſent diſtreſs and danger, they are ſo intoxicated with that <hi>vaſt ambition,</hi> that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93855:38"/>they ſlight a <hi>Treaty,</hi> and refuſe a <hi>Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this you, and the whole Nation ſaw before the laſt War; but it could not then be ſo well timed, or our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances ſo well made. But you judged aright, that at any rate, <hi>Delenda est Carthago,</hi> That Government was to be brought down. And therefore the King may well ſay to you, <hi>'Tis your War.</hi> He took his <hi>meaſures</hi> from you, and they were <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>right</hi> ones: and He expects a ſuitable <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> to ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and expenſive an Action; which He has hitherto maintained at His own charge, and was unwilling either to trouble you, or <hi>burden</hi> the <hi>Country,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it came to an <hi>inevitable neceſſity.</hi> And His Majeſty commands me to tell you, that unleſs it be a <hi>certain Sum,</hi> and <hi>ſpeedily raiſed,</hi> it can never anſwer the Occaſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reputation</hi> is the great ſupport of War or Peace. This War had never begun, nor had the <hi>States</hi> ever ſlighted the King, or ever refuſed Him <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> neither had this War continued to this day, or ſubſiſted now, but that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93855:38"/>the <hi>States</hi> were deceived in their <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> and apprehended His <hi>Majeſty</hi> in that great want of money, that He muſt ſit down under any Affronts, and was not able to begin, or carry on a War. Nay, at this day the States ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelves amongſt their People by this only <hi>falſhood,</hi> that they are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the temper of <hi>England,</hi> and of the parliament, and that you will not ſupply the King in this War: And that if they can hold out till your meeting, they will have new life, and may take new meaſures. There are lately taken two of their principal Agents, with their Credentials and Inſtructions to this purpoſe, who are now in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ſhall be proceeded againſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of Nations. But the King is ſufficiently aſſured of <hi>His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> Knows you better: and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubt His <hi>Parliament.</hi> This had not been mentioned, but to ſhew you of what importance the <hi>frankneſs</hi> and <hi>ſeaſonableneſs</hi> of this <hi>Supply</hi> is, as well as the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of it. Let me ſay, the King has brought the <hi>States</hi> to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that your hearty conjunction, at this time, in <hi>ſupplying</hi> His Majeſty, will make them never more formidable
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93855:39"/>to Kings, or dangerous to <hi>England.</hi> And if after this you ſuffer them to get up, let this be remembred, The States of <hi>Holland</hi> are <hi>Englands</hi> eternal Enemy both by Intereſt and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, to the ſupply for the carrying on of the War, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty recommends to you the taking care of His <hi>Debts.</hi> What you gave the laſt Seſſion did not near anſwer <hi>your own expectation.</hi> Beſides, another confiderable Aid you deſigned His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, was <hi>unfortunately loſt in the birth;</hi> ſo that the King was forced for the carrying on of His affairs, much againſt His will, to put a ſtop to the payments out of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> He ſaw the <hi>preſſures</hi> upon himſelf, and <hi>growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies</hi> to His People by great Intereſt; and the difference through all His Buſineſs between <hi>Ready money,</hi> and <hi>Orders.</hi> This gave the King the neceſſity of that proceeding; to make uſe of His own Revenue, which hath been of ſo great effect in this War. But though he hath put a ſtop to the trade, and gain of the <hi>Bankers,</hi> yet he would be unwilling to ruine them, and oppreſs ſo many Families as are
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93855:39"/>concerned in thoſe Debts; Beſides, it were too diſprortionable a burden upon many of His good Subjects. But neither the <hi>Bankers,</hi> nor they, have reaſon to complain, if you now take them into your care, and they have paid them what was due to them when the Stop was made, with Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt from that time. The King is very much concern'd both in <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> to ſee this done. And yet he deſires you not to miſ-time it: but that it may have only the ſecond place, and that you will firſt ſettle what you intend about the Supply.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty has ſo fully vindicated His Declaration from that Calumny concerning the Papiſts, that no reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcruple can be made by any good man. He has ſufficiently juſtified it by the time it was publiſhed in, and the effects He hath had from it; and might have done it more, from the agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, to His own natural diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which no good <hi>Engliſh</hi> man can wiſh other then it is. He loves not bloud, or rigorous ſeverities; but where mild, or gentle ways may be uſed by a <hi>wiſe Prince,</hi> He is certain to chooſe them. The Church of <hi>England</hi>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:93855:40"/>and all good <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> have reaſon to rejoyce in ſuch a <hi>Head,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender.</hi> His Majeſty doth declare His care and Concerns for the Church, and will maintain them in all their Rights and Priviledges, equal, if not beyond any of His Predeceſſors: He was born and bred up in it: It was that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died for: We all know how great temptations and offers He reſiſted abroad, when He was in His loweſt condition: And He thinks it the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of His Reign, that He hath been the <hi>Reſtorer</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> 'Tis that He will ever maintain, and hopes to leave to poſterity, in greater luſtre, and upon ſurer grounds, then our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors ever ſaw it. But His Majeſty is not convinc'd that <hi>violent ways</hi> are the Intereſt of <hi>Religion</hi> or the <hi>Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is one thing more which I am commanded to ſpeak to you of, Which is the <hi>jealouſie</hi> that hath been fooliſhly ſpread abroad, of the Forces the King hath raiſed in this War. Wherein the King hath <hi>opened himſelf freely</hi> to you, and confeſſed the fault on the other hand. For if this laſt Summer had not proved a <hi>miracle</hi> of <hi>Storms</hi> and <hi>Tempeſts,</hi> ſuch as ſecured their <hi>East-India</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:93855:40"/>Fleet, and protected their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt from a diſcent, nothing but the true reaſon (want of Money) could have juſtified the defect in the number of our Forces. 'Tis that His Majeſty is providing for againſt the next Spring, having given out Orders for the raiſing of ſeven or eight Regiments more of Foot, under the Command of Perſons of the greateſt Fortunes and Quality. And I am earneſtly to recommend to you, that in your Supplies, you will take into your conſideration this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>addition</hi> of <hi>charge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And after His Majeſties concluſion of His Speech, let me conclude, nay, let us all conclude with bleſſing God, and the King. Let us bleſs God, that he hath given us ſuch a King to be the Repairer of our Breaches both in Church and State: and the <hi>reſtorer of our paths to dwell in:</hi> That in the midſt of War and Miſery, which rages in our Neighbour Countries, our <hi>Garners are full,</hi> and <hi>there is no complaining in our Streets:</hi> And a Man can hardly know that there is a War. Let us bleſs God, that hath given this King ſignally the hearts of His People, and moſt particularly of this Parliament, who
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93855:41"/>in their Affection and Loyalty to their Prince, have exceeded all their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors. A <hi>Parliament</hi> with whom the King hath many years lived with all the Careſſes of a happy Marriage. Has the King had a <hi>concern?</hi> You have wedded it. Has His Majeſty wanted <hi>Supplies?</hi> You have readily, chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fully provided for them. You have relied upon the Wiſdom and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of His Majeſty in all His affairs: ſo that you have never attempted to exceed <hi>your bounds,</hi> or to <hi>impoſe</hi> upon Him: whileſt the King on the other hand, hath made your Counſels the foundations of all His proceedings; and hath been ſo tender of you, that he hath upon His own Revenue and Credit endeavoured to ſupport even Foreign Wars, that he might be leaſt uneaſie to you, or burdenſom to His People. And let me ſay, that tho' this Marriage be according to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> where the Husband can give a <hi>Bill of Divorce,</hi> put her away, and take another: Yet I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, it is as impoſſible for the King to part with this Parliament, as it is for you to depart from that Loyalty, Affection, and Dutiful Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <hi>viour,</hi>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:93855:41"/>you have hitherto ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Him.</p>
                     <p>Let us bleſs the King for taking away all our Fears, and leaving no room for Jealouſies: For thoſe Aſſurances and Promiſes He hath made us. Let us bleſs God and the King, that our Religion is ſafe: That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the care of our Prince: That Parliaments are ſafe: That our Properties and Liberties are ſafe. What more hath a good <hi>Engliſh</hi> man to ask, but that this King may long Reign, and that this Triple-Alliance of King, Parliament and People, may never be diſſolved?</p>

                     <p>It were too nice and tedious, and peradventure too formal, to give an account of the ſeveral diſtinct Powers of theſe two Offices, Reaſon and the length of time hath now ſo woven them together. But as they are both in your Lordſhip, I may juſtly ſay you are in a place of the firſt Rank, as to Dignity, Power, Truſt, and Influence of Affairs. A place that requires ſuch
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93855:48"/>a Man as our great Maſters Wiſdom hath found for it; from whoſe Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral temper we may expect Courage, Quickneſs and Reſolution; from whoſe Education, Wiſdom and Experience; and from whoſe Extraction, that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Illuſtrious Houſe of the <hi>Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords,</hi> an Heroick Mind, a large Soul, and an unſhaken Fidelity to the Crown.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, it's a great Honour much beyond even the place it ſelf, that you are choſen to it by this King, who without Flattery I may ſay, is as great a Maſter in the knowledge of Men and Things, as this or any other Age hath produced: And let me ſay farther, It is not only your Honour that you are choſen by Him, but it is your Safety too, that you have him to ſerve, with whom no ſubtile Inſinuations of any near him, nor the aſpiring Intereſt of a Favourite, ſhall ever prevail againſt thoſe that ſerve him well. Nor can his Servants fear to be ſacrificed to the Malice, Fury or Miſtake of a more ſwelling Popular greatneſs; a Prince under whom the unfortunate fall gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; a Prince, in a word, that beſt of

                     <p>THe King of his Grace and Favour hath made choice of you to be one of the Barons of the Exchequer; he deſigned to place you in a Court of more profit, though not of more Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but your own modeſty hath choſen this Court, where you thought you could ſerve the King beſt: and I could not chooſe but mention it here to your Honour; it being the greateſt Inſtance of a good Man, That he had rather be found ſerviceable than rich. His Majeſty hath had large proof of your former Service: beſides, he takes you upon the Credit of that Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, that hath juſtly the beſt place with him, I mean his Royal Brothers. Some few things it is fit I ſhould here mention to you, and leave with you as Admonitions, or rather Remembrances.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, you are to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Kings Prerogative; and let not the Kings Prerogative, and the Law, be two things with you; for the Kings Prerogative is Law, and the principal
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93855:49"/>of it: Therefore in maintaining that, you maintain the Law. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> is ſo excellently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven, that every part of the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative hath a broad mixture of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Subject; the eaſe and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the People being inſeparable from the greatneſs and ſecurity of the Crown.</p>
                     <p>In the next place let me adviſe you, that you acquaint your ſelf with the Revenue, as alſo the ancient Records, Precedents and Practices of this Court; for want of which knowledge, I have ſeen this Court a moſt excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas; when at the ſame time I could not ſay ſo much for it as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer.</p>
                     <p>In the Third place, Let me recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, ſo to manage the Kings Juſtice and the Revenue, as the King may have moſt profit, and the Subjects leaſt Vexation. Raking for old Debts, the number of Informations, Projects upon Concealments, I could not find (in the Eleven years Exprerience I have had in this Court) ever to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the Crown; but ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings have (for the moſt part) delivered up the Kings good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93855:50"/>into the hands of the worſt of Men.</p>
                     <p>There is another thing I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in this Court which I ſhall mind you of; which is, when the Court hearkens too much to the Clerks and Officers of it, and are too apt to ſend out Proceſs, when the Money may be raiſed by other ways, more eaſie to the People. I do not ſay that the Kings Duty ſhould be loſt, or that the ſtricteſt courſe ſhould not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, rather then that be; for when you conſider how much the Officers of this Court, and the Under-ſheriffs get by Proceſs upon ſmall Sums, more then the Kings Duty comes to; and upon what ſort of People this falls, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Farmer, Husbandman and Clothier in the Country, that is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the Collector, Conſtable and Tyſhingman; and ſo diſturbs the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious part of the Nation, you will think it fit to make that the laſt way, when no other will ſerve.</p>
                     <p>Give me leave alſo to mind you of one thing more, it is in your Oath, <hi>That the Kings Needs ye ſhill ſpeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others:</hi> that is, the buſineſs of the Revenue of the Crown you are to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93855:50"/>diſpatch before all other, and not turn your Court into a Court of Common-Pleas, and let that juſtle out what you were conſtituted for.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, Let me conclude with what concerns all my Lords the Judges as well as you, let me recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you the Port and Way of Living ſuitable to the Dignity of your Place, and what the King allows you. There is not any thing that gains more Reputation and Reſpect to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then that doth; and let me tell you, Magiſtrates as well as Merchants are ſupported by their Reputation.</p>

               <p>To his ſucceſsful Counſel do both King and Kingdom owe the happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Affairs for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the events of his Advices always agreeing with, and anſwering the Ends for which they were at firſt propoſed, ſo that the King ſeldom fail'd of any thing that was carried on by his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for which reaſon, his wiſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration and management of Things, had as it were incorporated him into the very Heart of his Prince: So that all Men began now to conclude, That this great Man (whoſe conſtant Loyalty
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93855:51"/>had render'd him ſo dear to His Majeſty) was too firmly fix'd and rooted in the Royal Favour, than ever to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or alienated therefrom; ſince he did, as moſt Men imagin'd, ſit ſo high, and withal ſo ſafely, that he was above the reach of Envy, or the poſſibility of being undermined by any ſubtle and falſe Inſinuations, or ſacrific'd to the malice of any aſpiring Favourite. Yet Fortune, who is always fickle, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in nothing but inconſtancy, never proved more falſe to any then ſhe did to him. And his unſhaken faithfulneſs to His Majeſty, from whoſe Intereſt no Temptation could ever allure him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Figure he made, and the High Station wherein he deſervedly ſtood, was ſo far from defending him againſt, that it ſubjected him to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and expoſed him to the ſpleenful hate, and inſatiable Revenge of thoſe who became his inveterate and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemies; for no other reaſon, then his extraordinary Zeal, to have His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſafe in his Perſon, by being Great in the Hearts of his Subjects, and Raign without a Competitor, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Formidable to his Enemies; and be able (like his Predeceſſors) to give
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93855:51"/>Laws to the Neighbouring Princes. The only way to promote the publick Good, maintain the Security of Religion, the Safety of the Government, and advance the Honour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.</p>
               <p>Wherefore they having reſolved upon his ruine; and knowing that the higher he mounted the more likely he would be to fall, and if he did fall, it would be with the greater precipitancy and danger: They rack'd all their Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and improved all their Intereſt at Court to have him advanc'd to higher Honour, although he was already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, even above his own Ambition, and thereby involved into ſo much danger, that he was forced every Night to keep a conſtant Guard about his Houſe, thereby to ſecure his Perſon from the bloody Attempts of Popiſh <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliacks,</hi> or <hi>Roman Godfredizers.</hi> So that this hopeful project not ſucceeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to expectation, may he rend by the future Ages in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Chronicles, to his immortal Glory, and the ſhame and infamy of his Enemies.</p>
               <p>But although they were not able with all their combinated ſtrengths to trample him into an Ignominious Grave, yet they quickly after found an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93855:52"/>of Triumph, upon the taking from him his Honourable Employment, to which he aſcended upon abundance of Merit, uſed with abundance of Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and reſigned with as much Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Honour, in the following manner:</p>
               <p>About <hi>November</hi> 1673. The King was pleaſed to ſend for his Lordſhip to <hi>Whitehall;</hi> where, upon His Majeſties Command, he reſigned the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> to be diſpoſed of as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould think fit. And thus this mighty Miniſter of State (who had, to the ſatisfaction and admiration of all good Men, and to the hurt and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice (and therefore to the hate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy) of none but the Papiſts, improved that Power whereunto the Grace and Favour of his Soveraign had raiſed him) did, without any kind of murmuring or repining, lay it down again at the Feet of him from whom he at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived it. Never abating of his uſual Briskneſs, nor altering the natural chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his Temper, upon the loſs of his Honorary Places: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when he had delivered the Seal,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93855:52"/>he put on his Sword; accounting it as much Honour and Happineſs to walk with that by his ſide unenvied, as to have the Mace and Purſe carried before him with abundance of Emulation and Grudge, beſides danger.</p>
               <p>In the Afternoon he was viſited at his Manſion-houſe by his Highneſs Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and divers other Peers and Gentlemen of Quality, who gratefully acknowledged themſelves to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly oblig'd by his juſt and honeſt diſcharge of that Truſt which had been repoſed in him, for which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him thanks.</p>
               <p>And many whoſe tedious or difficult Suits were diſcharged by his dexterity and wiſdom, will ever remember him with Honour and Veneration. For by his admirable Prudence, deep Judgment, and quick Apprehenſion, he uſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and that with abundance of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility and Eaſe, to penetrate into the moſt intricate and difficult Cauſes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe thoſe Cloudy Miſts wherewith the ſubtile Lawyer had darkened and perplexed the Juſt and Honeſt Title; as the Author of the Character of a Loyal Stateſ-man ingeniouſly expreſſes it:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93855:53"/>
                  <q>
                     <l>— His choice ſagacity,</l>
                     <l>Strait ſalv'd the knot that ſubtle Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers ty'd,</l>
                     <l>And through all Foggs diſcern'd the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſide:</l>
                     <l>Baniſh'd delays, and ſo this Noble Peer</l>
                     <l>Became a Star of Honour in our Sphere.</l>

               <p>And indeed he manag'd the Court of Chancery with ſuch an unbyaſs'd Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Uprightneſs, that forced even thoſe who loſt the Cauſe, to admire his ſagacity, and confeſs the equality of his Juſtice.</p>

Yet, to their amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and anguiſh, and the glory, and of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93855:54"/>that Divine Providence, whereby the Almighty, who fore-ſees the iſſue and events of all ſublunary Actions, wiſely orders, and diſpoſes all things to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the favourites of <hi>Heaven,</hi> they found no ſuch caſual flips, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights in his management, that could any way anſwer the pains they had taken in ſearching the <hi>Records</hi> of his Actions, or favour the Deſigns they were carrying on againſt him. For, having with a complicated malice, and impatiency of deſtroying him, who of all others, ſtood moſt in the way of their other Deſigns, amaz'd together, and muſtered up all the worſt things which thoſe <hi>Infallible Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> by the force of their <hi>Roman Venom,</hi> were able to draw, and attract out of the <hi>Court Rolls,</hi> ſo diſgeſted and phraſed, as might beſt ſerve the purpoſe to which they were deſigned, and preſented them to the King's Learned Council, in the Law, for their judgment, whether there were any thing contained therein, upon which they might find matter whereon to ground an accuſation of <hi>Treaſon.</hi> They did, after a ſerious peruſal of the ſeveral particulars, and pretended Crimes, affirm to their everlaſting Honour, that there was nothing which amounted to <hi>Treaſon,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93855:55"/>contained therein. So that all their pains and induſtry, noiſe and clamour, ſerved to no other purpoſe, than the expoſing there own folly and wickedneſs, and the making His Loyalty and Juſtice, ſhine with the more brightneſs and ſplendour; and the giving him a freſh provocation, as well as future opportunity, to pry more narrowly into, and with the greater vigour, oppoſe their <hi>Machivilian</hi> Deſigns, againſt His <hi>Soveraign,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> &amp; the intereſt of <hi>Brittain;</hi> and thereby ſadly fruſtrate their <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DDING HOPS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was it long before their pregnant and groaning Deſigns, gave him an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to demonſtrate his Zeal therein; for about <hi>April,</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> 1675. an odd kind of a Bill was unexpectedly offered one Morning in the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> whereby all ſuch as enjoyed any benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Offices or Imployments, <hi>Eccleſiaſtical, Civil,</hi> or <hi>Military:</hi> to which was added, <hi>Privy-Councellor, Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> were under a penalty to take the <hi>Oath,</hi> and make the Declaration and Abhorrence enſuing.</p>
               <p>I A. B. <hi>Do Declare, That it is not lawful upon any pretence whatſoever, to take up Arms againſt the King; And that I do
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93855:55"/>abhor that Trayterous poſition, of taking Arms by His Authority, againſt His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or thoſe that are Commiſſion'd by Him in purſuance of ſuch Commiſſion. And I do Swear, That I will not at any time endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any alteration of Government, either in</hi> Church <hi>or</hi> State. So help me God.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Oath</hi> was brought in the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> in the Plague Year, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and great endeavours uſed to have it impoſed upon the Nation; but was ſtrenuouſly oppoſed by the very ſame perſons, that now introduced it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> and by their aſſiſtance, thrown out as a pernicious thing, tending to the general infecting the Vitals of the Kingdom. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it then paſſed in a particular Bill, commonly known by the Name of the <hi>Five Mile Act,</hi> becauſe it only concerned the <hi>Nonconformiſt Preachers;</hi> yet, even in that, it was mightily oppoſed by that faithful Friend to the <hi>Crown,</hi> the late Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> whoſe ſentiments and judgment, in an Affair of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, might certainly have been account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Platform</hi> and <hi>Standard</hi> of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Loyalty. This <hi>Oath</hi> they ſaid was but a little thing, being only a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93855:56"/>moderate ſecurity to the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Crown.</hi> Yet, their ſo ſtifly defending it, when oppoſed by His Lordſhip, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, together with their fierce and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted endeavours, to have it paſs the <hi>Houſe,</hi> made all thinking men ſuſpect that there was ſome extraordinary Deſign wrapt up in it; and therefore contended for by them, not as a triffle, but a thing of that weight, that the whole ſtreſs of Affairs depended thereon. And indeed the Word Commiſſion, as it was there to be taken, was of an extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Latitude: for if it ſhould have been for taking away Eſtate or Life, by force; or if the perion Commiſſionated were under never ſo many diſabilities, by <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> yet, the taking that <hi>Oath,</hi> would have removed all thoſe Incapacities, or his Commiſſion would have ended the deſpute.</p>
               <p>So that it came at laſt to be one of the greateſt Conteſt, perhaps, that ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in <hi>Parliament;</hi> wherein his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and divers, other Illuſtrous <hi>Peers,</hi> being aſſured of their own Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Merit, ſtood up againſt the <hi>Oath,</hi> and pleaded for the Antient <hi>Engliſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties:</hi> with the ſame Pious Vertue, and Heroick Courage, and Reſolution,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93855:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>wherewith their Noble <hi>Anceſtors</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly defended the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of <hi>England;</hi> only they deſerved far greater Commendation and Honour, in regard they grapled with far greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and had not ſo fair a Field to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in, but fought it out, under all the diſadvantages imaginable; being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid by numbers, and the noiſe of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> like the wind, baring hard upon them: nor, being ſo few, could they as their Adverſaries, withdraw to refreſh themſelves, in a whole days engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet, never was there a fuller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. How dull a thing humane loquence is, and how ſmall and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable! The moſt towering and inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatneſs, when bright Truth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers all things in their proper colours, and dementions, and like the Sun, ſhoots its enlightning Rayes through all their fallacies. The Diſpute laſted many days, with much eagerneſs on both ſides, and was ſo warmly oppoſed, that the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was Prorogued before the <hi>Lords</hi> came to any Reſolution about it, but in the next Seſſions, they ordered it to be burnt: It might be injurious to the reſt of the Noble <hi>Lords,</hi> who took part with him therein, to attribute the whole ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93855:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>to him; yet, the Promoters accuſed him of having firſt oppoſed it, and that he and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> ſtirred up, and influenced the reſt.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Popiſh Party, who, it's probable, hop'd to have reaped the greateſt advantage by that <hi>Oath</hi> banded againſt him, with as much fierceneſs as ever; and although they had failed of Murthering his Perſon, yet reſolved to accompliſh the ruine of his Reputation, influencing ſeveral <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as well <hi>Clergy,</hi> as <hi>Laiety,</hi> to lend their helping hand to this great Work. The former were to beſpatter him in their Pulpits, as if they were Conjuring down the Devil, inſtead of commending the Bleſſed Jeſus, in the Tenders of the Goſpel. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were to beſpatter him with their Pens, thereby to procure him the hatred of the Vulgar, who commonly take up things upon Truſt, and believe every thing they read to be true: and becauſe they could procure no better, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed <hi>Needham,</hi> a mercenary Wretch, who had, with an audacious impudence, and unparalell'd virulency, Writ againſt two Kings; <hi>(Viz.)</hi> Our preſent <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi> and His <hi>Royal Father,</hi> and therefore the more fit for ſuch an undertaking.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93855:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>His firſt Eſſay, was in a Libellous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, called, <hi>Advice to the Men of Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> wherein he falſely charged him with many fictitious Crimes, and imaginary Deſigns, againſt the <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus having prepared the way to his ruine, (as they imagined) they hoped to accompliſh by it an accident which happened quickly after in the enſuing Parliament, which met <hi>February 15th.</hi> 1676. after 15 months Prorogation upon this occaſion. As ſoon as the King had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his Speech, the Commons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and the Lords had taken their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Seats: The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who uſually ſays what he thinks, ſtood up and argued with great ſtrength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that according to the Laws and Conſtitution of Parliaments, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſidented Prorogation was null, and the Parliament conſequently Diſſolved, offering moreover to maintain it to all the Judges; and deſiring, as hath been uſual in ſuch Caſes, That they might give their Opinions; but a certain Lord fancying himſelf a better Judg of that weighty Point in Law, moved that the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> might be called to the Bar; whereupon his Lordſhip ſtood up and oppoſed it as an extravagant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93855:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>and aſcertain'd the validity of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>'s Propoſals with all the Cicilian height of Courage and Reaſon. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon another Lord of no leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the former, who had called the Duke to the Bar, ſtood up in as great pet, as if the Salt had been thrown down, or ſome ſuch like ominous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had happened, and with abundance of earneſtneſs renewed the motion for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Duke to the Bar; but there were too many Lords between for that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſucceed, and advice was brought every moment from the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that the things was yet in agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, among them which gave his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip an opportunity to appear with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary vigour in defence of the Duke's Perſon, and his Propoſal, ſo that the Earl ſeem'd more properly another Principle than the Duke's Second: Whereupon the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore undertook on the contrary to make the Prorogation look very formidable, laying the beſt colour upon it, and the worſt upon his Opponants. Thus, for five or ſix hours, it grew to be a fixed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; many arguing it on both ſides in a regular method, until they received the welcome News, that the Commons were
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93855:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>riſen without doing any thing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the greater number called for the Queſtion, and had it in the affirmative, that the Debate ſhould be laid aſide.</p>
               <p>And thus being flaſht, but not ſatisfied with their Victory, they fell deſperately upon them, who had affirmed the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution the ſame night, and the next day voted his Lordſhip with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> to be commited to the Tower, under the Notion of Contempt, during his Majeſties, and the Houſes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The Contempt for which they were committed, was their refuſing to recant their Opinions, and ask pardon of the King, and the Houſe of Lords, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the liberty and freedom of Speech, which His Majeſty verbally, and of courſe allows them at the opening of every Parliament. The Warrant for the committing his Lordſhip, together with the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wharton;</hi> ran Thus,</p>

               <p>THE four Lords continued in the Tower ſo long, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſeveral times Adjourned du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Confinement, which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip bore with abundance of patience, and incredible chearfulneſs, conſidering the many weakneſſes and infirmities of Body he then laboured under: They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have been Releaſed, at leaſt of courſe, by Prorogation; but Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was ſo much in uſe at that time, that it made them deſpair of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived that way, wherefore finding no end of their Captivity, they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the procuring their Liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve as much care as others took to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

               <p>Whereupon, his Lordſhip applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> the conſtant Reſidence of His Majeſties Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, whether he was brought <hi>Wedneſday, Jan.</hi> 27. 1677. upon the Return of an <hi>Alias Habeas Corpus,</hi> directed to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of the Tower; and there being ſome diſpute about the ſufficiency of the Return, his Council prays to have the Return filled, and <hi>Friday</hi> appointed to debate the ſufficiency of it; which being granted, the Earl was re-manded back again unto the Tower.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> morning his Lordſhip was brought up again, and then the Caſe was ſtrongly and learnedly argued on both ſides; and after the diſcuſſing the Point

               <p>The Attorney and Solicitor Generals argued the contrary; ſhewing divers Cauſes why that Court could not relieve a perſon committed by Parliament.

They have told you, that my Council in their Arguments ſaid, That this Court was greater than the Houſe of Peers, which I dare to appeal to your Lordſhips and the whole Court, that it was never ſpoken by them, I am ſure it was not ſpoken by any direction of mine: What is done by my Council and by me, is, That this Court is the moſt proper place to reſort unto in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93855:60"/>thoſe Caſes where the Liberty of the Subject is concerned. The Lords Houſe is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Court of Judicature in the Kingdom, but yet there is a Juriſdiction which the Lords Houſe do not meddle with. The Kings Council mentioned as a wonder, that a Member of the Lords Houſe ſhould come hither, and thereby diminiſh the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that Court.

They claim not to meddle in Original Caſes, and ſo I might mention in other things: And I do not think it a kindneſs to any Power or Body of Men, to give them a Power or Juriſdiction, which is not natural or proper to their Conſtitutions. I do not think it would be any kindneſs to the Lords to make them abſolute and above the Law, for ſo I humbly conceive this muſt do if it be adjudged that they, by a general War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or without any particular Cauſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, do commit me or any man to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and indefinite Impriſonment: And my Lords, I am not ſo inconſiderable a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but what you do in my Caſe muſt be Law for every man in <hi>England.</hi> Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi>

               <p>And thus his Lordſhip, being denied redreſs in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> until the <hi>February</hi> following; and then on the fourteenth of that Month, the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> being then ſitting, he preſented a Petition to the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> wherein he makes a very humble ſubmiſſion, both to His Majeſty, and the <hi>Houſe of Peers:</hi> but they objecting againſt the Petitions he had preſented to His Majeſty, as not having made a ſatisfactory acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Crimes, after ſome debate, rejected this Petition.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the weak condition he was then brought into, by his confinement, requiring ſpeedy enlargement, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented another Petition to His Majeſty, and likewiſe to the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> in both which he renued his Supplication, to be releaſed from his impriſonment. And not only acknowledged with all humble ſubmiſſion, That his endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to maintain the <hi>Parliaments</hi> being Diſſolv'd, was an ill adviſed Action; (and ſo muſt every Man acknowledg,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93855:63"/>who will ſtrive in vain to ſail againſt Wind and Tide,) but in the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive Terms, aſſured them, that he was ready to make what further acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſubmiſſion they ſhould require, and that in the way and manner too, which they ſhould pleaſe to direct; yet, unfortunate Earl, he could not obtain his Liberty upon theſe Terms neither, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretence being then laid hold on, for the prolonging his Impriſonment. Which was the horrid Crime of endeavouring his enlargment, by applying himſelf to the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> in order to his being admitted to Bail. And yet, a certain Gentleman in the World, who had at that time, a mighty influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Affairs, and improved this imaginary fault, as much as poſſible, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Earl; hath ſince that time, been himſelf, guilty of the ſuppoſed Crime. And not only ſo, but hath rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo more pertinacious therein, by his reiterated applications to that Court, to take Bail for him.</p>

               <p>THis Petition being read, the Lord Chancellor acquainted the Houſe, that His Majeſty had received a Third Petition from the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> more ſubmiſſive than the two former. But His Majeſty underſtanding that he had endeavoured to free himſelf from the cenſure of this Houſe, by appealing to the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> to have there judgment thereupon during the late Adjournments: doth not think fit as yet, to ſignifie his pleaſure as to his diſcharge, until this Houſe hath taken that matter into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>

Upon which the Lords refuſing to make an Addreſs to His Majeſty, for his Lordſhips diſcharge, entered into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate concerning his Appeal from their Houſe to the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> for an <hi>Habeas Corpus:</hi> but not being able to come to any Reſolution about it that day, the next day it was reſumed again, and the Records of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> produced, by which it did appear, that two Rules of Court had been obtain'd upon the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Lordſhips Council, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns thereupon were read; by which it did appear, that the Earl had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1676. for a Contempt committed againſt the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> and then the remitture of the Earl to the <hi>Tower</hi> was read. After this, a Petition from his Lordſhip to the Houſe was read, wherein he took notice of an Order of the Houſe, for bringing thither the Records of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Court, concerning the matter of an <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> brought by him; acquainting them, that he took himſelf to be very much concern'd, that they ſhould enter into a debate of that Nature, in his abſence, ſince he had an undoubted Right to be preſent, and plead for himſelf, when a debate of any new matter againſt him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93855:65"/>was entred upon: and that although he could not pretend, but that there might be a probability of his having err'd, for want of a Preſident to guide him, and being deprived of the benefit of Council, by reaſon of his cloſe confinement, yet he reſolved not to do any thing willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that might in the leaſt offend His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, or their Lordſhips; and therefore, humbly laid hold of that opportunity, to give further Evidence thereof, by caſting himſelf at their Lordſhips feet, and as he humbly begg'd the Pardon of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, ſo he alſo implored the forgiveneſs of their Lordſhips, for offending them in any thing whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The debate was ſomewhat long, but at laſt it came to this Iſſue.</p>
               <p>They Reſolved, and Declared, That it was a breach of the priviledge of that Houſe, for any Lord, committed by them, to bring an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> in any inſeriour Court, to free himſelf from that Impriſonment, during the Seſſion of Parliament; and that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> ſhould have Liberty to make his full defence, notwithſtanding the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and Declaration, aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>Then was one <hi>Blany</hi> called into the Houſe, who had delivered a Paper to the Lord Treaſurer, pretending to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome words, ſpoken by his Lordſhip, in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> when he moved to be bailed there. But though this whole Tranſaction was no longer than ſince laſt <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, yet, <hi>Blany</hi> could not affirm that what was Written in the ſaid Paper, was really ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by his Lordſhip; ſo that the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer not being able to to make any thing of <hi>Blanys</hi> Story, (which was an hard Caſe, that ſo much pains ſhould be taken to ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93855:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>little purpoſe) the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to a Reſolution, in what form his Lordſhip ſhould make his ſubmiſſion, and acknowledgment: which being drawn up, imported much the ſame, with which he had before Declared: which being read to him by the Lord Chancellor, his Lordſhip repeated the ſame at the Bar, and than withdrew.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Houſe ordered, That the Lords with white ſleeves, ſhould wait upon His Majeſty, and acquaint him the Houſe had received ſatisfaction from his Lordſhip, in the matter of the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and the other Contempt, for which he ſtood committed, and were become humble Suters to His Majeſty, that he would be pleaſed to diſcharge him from his Impriſonment: and that their Lordſhips acquaint the Houſe with His Majeſties Anſwer. All which was done accordingly, and the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer reported to the Houſe, That the Lords with white ſleeves, had waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His Majeſty, according to their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Order. And that His Majeſty was pleaſed to make this Anſwer, <hi>That he would give Order for his Lordſhips diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,</hi> which was accordingly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and his Lordſhip, by regaining his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93855:67"/>Liberty, made more capable of ſerving His Majeſty, and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, againſt the dark and miſterous deſigns, which were then carrying on againſt both.</p>
               <p>But although the Lords proceeded with ſo much rigure and ſeverity, againſt his Lordſhip, (who deſerved to have been more kindly dealt withal by any, who pretend to any Loyalty to their Prince, ſince he made ſo conſiderable a Figure, and had ſo great a ſhare in the contriving, and management of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Revolution, in 1666.) when they were in an unuſual heat, artificialy kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and carefully blown into a Flame, by ſome unſeen hand, who ſecretly manag'd the Bellows: yet, when that heat had ſpent it ſelf, and the Houſe acted with more freedom, and deliberation, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the wrong and injury, done to his Lordſhip and the other Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were committed upon that account: and to prevent that illegal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from being made uſe of, as a Preſident in future times, they damned the ſeveral proceedings thereon, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Commitment, and all things that concerned that Affair, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pung'd, and raz'd out of their Jornal
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93855:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>Books: that ſo, if poſſible, the very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of them might be extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>And thus this illuſterous Peer, did at length regain his Liberty, although ſomewhat ſooner, perhaps, than his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Enemies deſired, or expected he ſhould: but not without being ſeveraly burleſqued, by a ſecond <hi>Advice to the Men of Shaftsbury,</hi> Written by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the former; hoping by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and unwearied charging him with many fictitious Crimes, ſlyly inſinuated, and audatiouſly affirmed, with all the confidence and formality, imaginable; they ſhould at length, get them believed to be real ones. The whole Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both of this, and the former Advice, was made up of nothing in the World, but malice and revenge, carefully infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the mercinary wretch, by the ſame aſpring Favourite, who had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Earls Application to the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> into a Crime; and were inbibed by him, with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable greedineſs, hoping thereby to relieve his wants, and ſupply his neceſſity; and as liberally caſt out in thoſe two ſcurilous Libels, to poyſon, and infect the froth of the Town, and the ſcum of the Univerſities, and that they might be the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93855:68"/>more ſucceſsful, the Name of the Author is carefully conceal'd, not from any ſparks of modeſty, but that he might thereby with the more advantage, and ſecurity, exerciſe his Impudence, in defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Earl: wiſely conſidering, That if his Name (which juſtly deſerves to be Intom'd, and Rot in his own infamy) ſhould have been perfixed to them, it would certainly have ſpoiled the Deſign, by making it appear too bare-fac'd. And indeed, it redounds very much to the Earls Honour, and Renown, that his Enemies could procure no other to Write againſt him, than one, whoſe Pen had been ſo long implyed againſt his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all thoſe devices, the Earls Honour, and Reputation, was above the reach of their malice, as well as his Loyalty had been above the reach of their poyſon, and infection. Nor was he thereby diſcouraged from oppoſing the Deſigns of the Papiſhes, as vigorouſly as ever: but endeavoured notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the ſeveral Seſſions of Parliament, to procure the paſſing ſuch wholſome Laws, as might reſtrain Debauchery, and ſecure us againſt the growing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93855:68"/>to undermine the Proteſtant Religion, the intereſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and prejudice, and endanger His Majeſties Perſon, and Government. But more eſpecially thoſe two admirable Bills; The firſt whereof provided, That no Papiſh ſhould hold any Offices, or enjoy any places of profit, or truſt, either <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Military:</hi> upon which His Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs laid down ſeveral great Offices and Places, which were held, and enjoyed by him. And the ſecond, for the diſabling any Papiſh from ſiting as a Member in either Houſe of Parliament, although this latter could not paſs without a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,</hi> that it ſhould not extend to the Duke of <hi>YORK.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, theſe Acts of Parliament did not prevent there proceeding in thoſe monſtrous Deſigns, which they had ſo long been forming in their ſecret Cabals: To Murther the King, ſubvert the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Maſſacre the Proteſtant No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and Gentry, extirpate the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and introduce Popery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Kingdom. Having for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, maintained Correſpondence with a Neighbouring Prince, procured indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences from <hi>Rome,</hi> to diſpence with their taking the Oaths of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,</hi>

                  </gap> at <hi>Rome</hi>) Kings Reign, and Princes Decree, Juſtice, it was ſeaſonably diſcovered, to their amazement, and confuſion, whereby they were driven to the very depths of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; fearing that their Villany being ſo plainly diſcovered, and their Cruelty, and Treaſon expoſed, and undeniably proved by <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Murther, <hi>Arnald</hi>'s Aſſaſſination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſhould never be able to clear themſelves, and retrieve their Plot. However, they Reſolved to attempt both the one, and the other, by charging his Lordſhip, and others, who had been the moſt Zealous Proſecuters of the Plot; not only of having invented this Plot, which they affirmed was altogether a fiction, but alſo with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on a Treaſonable Deſign againſt the King's Majeſty, under colour thereof.</p>
               <p>The Plot being thus diſcovered, his Lordſhip being moved by a Principal of Loyalty, to His Majeſties Love, to his Country, and Zeal to the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; endeavoured to the utmoſt of his power, to have it narrowly enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and ſearched to the bottom, that ſo the miſchevious Conſequences of it might be the better provided againſt: and the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93855:70"/>King's Perſon, and Government, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, might by an early Proviſion, be ſecured againſt the like attempts, for the future, as well as the preſent fruſtrated, which ſo much enraged them, that it added fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el to their malice, and ſharpened their deſire of accompliſhing his ruine. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves, as the Lords in the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> told Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> That if they were as well rid of him, as they were of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> they ſhould then be able to conquer all difficulties, ſtifle the Popiſh Plot, and bear down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Wherefore, finding him the greateſt hinderance to their Deſigns, and the moſt active Man in proſecuting their Plot, they entered into a Reſolution, to diſpatch him into another World: as was affirmed by —Meſſenger, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Horſe, to the Lord <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> of <hi>Warder,</hi> about three Weeks, or a Month, before Mr. <hi>William Stayley</hi> was apprehended: even ſo early did they begin their Deſigns of Murthering him, for endeavouring to expoſe their Plot. And not long after, <hi>Stayley,</hi> and <hi>Mattiſſon,</hi> being together at the <hi>Croſs-Keys</hi> Tavern, in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> Declared, That to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſeverities which might be the

               <p>But after this, their rage was heigthned, and they ſuppoſed themſelves obliged to a greater vigilancy, in accompliſhing his ruine, upon the account of a Speech which was ſaid to be ſpoken by him in the <hi>Houſe of Lords, March,</hi> 25. 1679. upon occaſion of the Houſes Reſolving it ſelf into State of <hi>England,</hi> which was to the following Effect.</p>

                        </hi> are now appointing the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the State of <hi>England,</hi> to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in a Committee of the whole Houſe, ſome day the next Week. I do not know how well
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93855:71"/>what I have to ſay may be received, for I never ſtudy either to make my Court well, or to be popular; I alwaies ſpeak what I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the dictates of the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me. There are ſome other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that concern <hi>England</hi> ſo nearly, that without them you will come far ſhort of Safety and Quiet at home. We have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Siſter and ſhe hath no Breaſts, what ſhall we do for our Siſter in the day when ſhe ſhall be ſpoken for? If ſhe be a Wall, we will build on her a Palace of Silver; if ſhe be a Door, we will incloſe her with Boards of <hi>Caedar.</hi> We have ſeveral little Siſters without Breaſts, the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtant Churches, the two Kingdoms of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> the forraign Proteſtants are a Wall, the only Wall and Defence to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> upon it you may build Palaces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, glorious Palaces. The protection of the Proteſtants abroad, is the greateſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſecurity the Crown of <hi>England</hi> can attain to, and which can only help us to give check to the growing greatneſs of <hi>France. Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are two Doors, either to let in good or miſchief upon us; they are much weakned by the Artifice of our cunning Enemies, and we ought to encloſe them with Boards of <hi>Caedar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Popery and Slavery, like two Siſters, go
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93855:71"/>hand in hand, ſometimes the one goes firſt, ſometimes the other, but wherever the one enters, the other is always following cloſe at the Heels.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>England</hi> Popery was to have brought in Slavery; in <hi>Scotland</hi> Slavery went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and Popery was to follow. I do not think your Lordſhips, or the Parliament have Juriſdiction there. It is a Noble and Ancient Kingdom; they have an Illuſtrious Nobility, a Gallant Gentry, a Learned Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and an underſtanding, worthy People; but yet we cannot think of <hi>England</hi> as we ought, without reflecting on the condition thereof. They are under the ſame Prince, and the influence of the ſame Favourites, and Councils: When they are hardly dealt with, can we that are Richer expect better uſuage? For 'tis certain, that in all abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Governments, the pooreſt Countries are moſt favourably dealt with. When the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Nobility there cannot enjoy their Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties, their Shrievaldoms, and their Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardies, which they and their Anceſtors have poſſeſſed for ſeveral hundred of years, but that now they are enjoyn'd by the Lords of the Council to make Deputations of their Authorities to ſuch as are their known Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, can we expect to enjoy our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> long, under the ſame perſons and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93855:72"/>Adminiſtration of Affairs? If the Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Table there can impriſon any Nobleman, or Gentleman, for ſeveral years, without bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to Tryal, or giving the leaſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for what they do: can we expect the ſame men will preſerve the Liberty of the Subject here?</p>
                     <p>My Lords, I will confeſs that I am not very well vers'd in the particular Laws of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but this I do know, that all the Northern Countries have by their Laws an undoubted and inviolable Right to their Liberties, and Properties; yet <hi>Scotland</hi> hath out-done all the Eaſtern and Southern Countries, in having their Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Eſtates ſubjected to the Arbitrary Will and Pleaſure of thoſe that govern. They have lately plundered and haraſſed the richeſt and wealthieſt Countries of that Kingdom, and brought down the barbarous <hi>Highlanders</hi> to devour them; and all this almoſt without a colourable pretence to do it: Nor can there be found a Reaſon of State for what they have done; but that thoſe wicked Miniſters deſigned to procure a Rebellion at any Rate; which as they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged it, was only prevented by the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous hand of God, or otherwiſe all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in <hi>England</hi> would have been armed, and the faireſt opportunity given, in the nick
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93855:72"/>of time for the execution of that wicked and bloody Deſign the Papiſts had: and it is not poſſible for any man that duly conſiders it, to think other, but that thoſe Miniſters that acted that, were as guilty of the Plot as any of the Lords that are in Queſtion for it.</p>
                     <p>My Lords, I am forced to ſpeak this the plainer, becauſe till the preſſure be fully and clearly taken off from <hi>Scotland,</hi> 'tis not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me, or any thinking man to believe that good is meant us here. We muſt ſtill be upon our guard apprehending that the Principle is not changed at Court, and that thoſe men that are ſtill in place and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, have that influence upon the mind of Our Excellent Prince, that he is not, nor cannot be that to us, that his own Nature and Goodneſs would incline him to. I know your Lordſhips can order nothing in this; but there are thoſe that hear me which can put a perfect cure to it; until that be done, the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Weed is like Death in the pot, <hi>Mors in Olla.</hi> But there is ſomething too, now I conſider, that moſt immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us, their Act of Twenty two Thouſand Men to be ready to invade us upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This I hear, that the Lords of the Council there have treated as they do all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Laws, and expounded it into a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93855:73"/>Army of Six Thouſand Men. I am ſure we have Reaſon and Right to beſeech the King, that that Act may be better conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the next Parliament there. I ſhall ſay no more for <hi>Scotland</hi> at this time, I am afraid your Lordſhips will think I have ſaid too much, having no concern there: but if a <hi>French</hi> Nobleman ſhould come to dwell in my Houſe and Family, I ſhould think it concerned me to ask what he did in <hi>France;</hi> for if we were there a Felon, a Rogue, a Plunderer, I ſhould deſire him to live elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; and I hope your Lordſhips will do the ſame thing for the Nation, if you find Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>My Lords, Give me leave to ſpeak two or three words concerning our other Siſter, <hi>Ireland:</hi> Thither I hear is ſent <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Regiment, to ſecure us againſt the <hi>French.</hi> Beſides, I am credibly informed that the Papiſts have their Arms reſtor'd, and the Proteſtants are not many of them yet reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from being the ſuſpected Party. The <hi>Sea-Towns</hi> as well as the <hi>In-land,</hi> are full of Papiſts: That Kingdom cannot long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hands, if ſome better care be not taken of it. This is in your Power, and there is not bing there but is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Laws. Therefore I beg, that this Kingdom at leaſt, may be taken into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93855:73"/>together with the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for I am ſure there can be no ſafety here, if theſe Doors are not ſhut up and made ſure.</p>

               <p>But His Majeſty had another kind of eſteem for his Lordſhip, for not long after the making of this Speech, having Diſſolv'd His Privy Council, and choſen a new one, he was pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Earl Preſident thereof; a Place ſo conſiderable for Honour and Truſt, that it hath not been enjoyed by any Subject for many years, and was improv'd by him as much to the advantage of His Majeſty and the Proteſtant Intereſt, as poſſible.</p>
               <p>And when the Bill for excluding the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> had paſſed the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> as the only expedient they could find out to ſuppreſs the Deſigns of the Papiſts, and prevent their ever intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Popiſh Religion into <hi>England;</hi> they ſent it up to the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> where his Lordſhip was one of thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Lords, who Voted for its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that Houſe, in order to its being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to His Majeſty, for His Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Jury</hi> returned for the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93855:74"/>of <hi>Oſalſtone,</hi> in the County of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex,</hi> in <hi>June</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> 1680. finding the Conſtables defective in not preſenting the Papiſts as they ought: it was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ſhould make further preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the <hi>16th.</hi> of that Inſtant, upon which day they met again to receive them, when likewiſe a Bill againſt <hi>D. Y.</hi> for not coming to Church, was brought before them, together with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſons for his being indicted, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the perſons undernam'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>25th. Car. 2d.</hi> when an Act was made to throw Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants out of all Offices, and Places of Truſt: the Duke did then lay down ſeveral great Offices and Places, (as <hi>Lord High Admiral of England, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo of all His Majeſties Forces,</hi> both by Land and Sea, <hi>Governour of the Cinque Ports,</hi> and divers others,) thereby to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the puniſhmant of that Law againſt Papiſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> 30. <hi>Car. 2d.</hi> when an Act was made to diſable Papiſts to ſit in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Houſe of Parliament,</hi> there was a <hi>Proviſo</hi> incerted in that Act, That it ſhould not extend to <hi>D. Y.</hi> on purpoſe to ſave his right of ſitting in the Lords Houſe, though he refuſed to take thoſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93855:74"/>Oaths which the Proteſtant Peers ought to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That His Majeſty in His Speech, <hi>March 6th.</hi> the 31ſt. year of his Reign, doth give for a Reaſon to the Parliament, why he ſent His Brother out of <hi>England, (Viz.)</hi> Becauſe he would leave no Man Room to ſay that he had not remov'd all Cauſes which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence him to Popiſh Councils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That there hath been divers Letters read in both <hi>Houſes of Parliament,</hi> and at the ſecret Committee of both Houſes, from ſeveral Cardinals and others, at <hi>Rome,</hi> and alſo from other Popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Agents of the Pope, in other Forreign Parts: which do apparently ſhew the great Correſpondencies between him and the Pope, and how the Pope could not chooſe but weep for joy, at the reading of ſome of his Letters, and what great ſatisfaction it was to the Pope, to hear that he was advanced to the Catholick Religion; as likewiſe that the Pope hath granted him <hi>Briefs,</hi> ſent him <hi>Beads,</hi> and ample <hi>Indulgencies,</hi> with much more to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The whole <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> hath Declared him to be a Papiſt in their Votes, <hi>Sunday, April, 6th.</hi> 1679.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93855:75"/>wherein they reſolv'd <hi>nemine contradicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s being a Papiſt, and his hopes of coming ſuch to the Crown, had given the greateſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and encouragement to the preſent Conſpiracy, and Deſigns of the Papiſts, againſt the King and the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That beſides all this Proof, and much more to this purpoſe, it is moſt notorious and evident, he hath for many years abſented from Proteſtant Churches, during Religious Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Reaſons why we believe him to be a Papiſt; this was ſubſcribed, and delivered by his Lordſhip, together with the Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> and the Lords, <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wark, Ruſſel, Cavendiſh, Brandon,</hi> and <hi>Wharton:</hi> as alſo by Sir <hi>William Cowper,</hi> Barronet, Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerrard,</hi> Barronet, Sir <hi>Edward Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> Knight of the Bath, Sir <hi>Scroop How, Thomas Thinn,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
                  <hi>William Forreſter,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>John Trenchard,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </p>
               <p>But whilſt the Jury were in debate of the Matter, they were ſent for up by the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and diſmiſt, ſo that nothing was done upon it more than the Juries having receieved the preſentment. Wherefore, on <hi>Wedneſday, July,</hi> the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93855:75"/>the former Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen, with the addition of the Lord <hi>Clare,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cope,</hi> Barronet, Sir <hi>Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Gwynne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wandsford,</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame to a ſecond <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> who were diſcharged as the former.</p>
               <p>But whilſt his Lordſhip was thus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly proſecuting the Popiſh Plot, in the face of danger, the Papiſts were as vigilent in contriving his ruine, though with ſomewhat more ſecrecy and ſilence, reſolving to ſeize the Prey before they gave the leaſt Alarm or Notice of their intention, as appear'd by their cloſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balliſtical Deſigns, carryed on againſt this Earl, and all the reſt of the Proteſtant Nobility, and Gentry in <hi>England,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was a conſiderable Agent, having been for that purpoſe fetcht out of <hi>Newgate,</hi> by the Papiſts; who hoping to reap a vaſt advantage by having him to manage their Affairs, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly disburſt a large ſum to diſcharge his Debts. The firſt ſangunary work they imployed him in was, to attempt the Murther of his Lordſhip, promiſing him 500 pounds for ſo acceptable a ſervice (as they apprehended it to be) he inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Reaſon why they thirſted after his Life, and how there might be any
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93855:76"/>probable way propoſed, whereby it might be accompliſhed? to which it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. That as to the firſt, they ſhould be glad to have him out of the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if they were rid of him, as they were of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> it would be no difficult thing to bear down all the reſt of their Oppoſers. As to the ſecond, They affirmed it to be as eaſie as deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſince, ſaid the Lord <hi>P—s,</hi> my Man <hi>Wood</hi> was at <hi>Thannet</hi> Houſe, two nights ſince, upon pretence of an Errand, but his buſineſs was to view the Houſe, and obſerve what conveniences there were to make his eſcape after the fact was done: aſſuring him that <hi>Wood</hi> found the thing ſo feaſable, that after he came back, he declar'd himſelf ſorry that he was not provided to have done it then. And to encourage him to undertake this ſanguinary enterpriſe with the more chearfulneſs, he gave him Ten Guinneys in hand, as an aſſurance that the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhould be paid ſo ſoon as the fatal ſtroak ſhould be given. Promiſing moreover, that Mr. <hi>Regaut,</hi> a <hi>Virginia</hi> Merchant, of Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> acquaintance, ſhould come to him on <hi>Sunday</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to inſtruct him in the moſt dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and probable means of putting the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93855:76"/>Deſign in execution, and ſecure the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the 500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p>All things being thus agreed on, the Lord <hi>P—s,</hi> took him by the hand, and wiſhed him good ſucceſs; And to render him the more pliable and active in this deſigned Tragady, he was ſent firſt to the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> then to <hi>Sharp</hi> the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and laſt of all to <hi>Jack Gadbury</hi> the <hi>Fortune-Teller:</hi> by all whom he was ſeverely ſcoulded, for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the Popiſh Lords in their command to kill the King, inſolently upbraiding him with horrid ingratitude, in refuſing to perform that for which he was taken out of Priſon and maintained in ſo much ſplendour, ever ſince. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that this chiding might raiſe in him a magnanimous Reſolution to regain the Credit he had loſt by that refuſal, by a Reſolute perpetrating the Murther of his Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dangerfield</hi> being thus prepared, on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following <hi>Regaut</hi> came to Mrs. <hi>Celliers,</hi> and having firſt dined together, he gave him general directions how to accompliſh the Murder, demanding how he would order the Mony to be paid, when he had performed the enterpriſe? telling him, that if he pleaſed, it ſhould
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93855:77"/>be brought in Guinneys, and leſt with Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> for him; but he diſliking the way, deſired, That when <hi>Regaut</hi> heard that the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was Dead, and ſhould receive a Note from him, that then he would immediately pay the Mony for his uſe, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſhould be done accordingly. But ordered him to attend on <hi>Sharp,</hi> and ſome others, for more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtructions, how to Act this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy; He attended upon them ſeveral times, before they could reſolve what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he ſhould take. However, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his flaging, he was commanded by the Conſpirators to repair to <hi>Knowles</hi> the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> to confeſs, and receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which he did at <hi>Knowles</hi>'s Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at a <hi>Coffe-Houſe</hi> in <hi>White-fryars,</hi> from whom he received ſome directions, how to proceed in the Murther: but <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> telling him that they were ſilly and impractable, <hi>Knowles</hi> ſent him to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Abergaveny,</hi> telling him that ſhe was a Witty Lady, and had ſome Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and therefore was the more capable of advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him. Wherefore he preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to her Lodgings at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Griſſin,</hi> in great <hi>Lincolns-Inn Fields,</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:93855:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>where he found eaſie admittance into her Ladyſhips Chamber, upon ſending in word that he came from <hi>Knowles.</hi> So ſoon as he entered, he acquainted her who he was, and the buſineſs he waited upon her Ladyſhip about. Sir, ſaid ſhe, I have received a very good Character of you, and therefore think my ſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to return you thanks for the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diligence wherewith you have managed our buſineſs hitherto, and I hope you will proceed with the like care until you have finiſhed what you have ſo well begun. As for the taking the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> out of the way, it's a thing of no difficulty, it being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as eaſie to kill him, as to kill a Bird on a Tree. Pray Madam, which way ſhall I do it, with ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and eaſe, ſaid <hi>Dangerfield?</hi> why ſeveral waies, replyed the Lady, it may be done; but I would have you pretend to Cure the <hi>Gout,</hi> and my Lord being troubled with that Diſtemper, I will recommend you to him under that pretence, whereby you will eaſily gain admittance, which having obtained, you muſt watch your oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to diſpatch him.</p>
               <p>From thence <hi>Dangerfield</hi> went to <hi>P—s</hi>'s Houſe, and acquainted the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93855:78"/>Counteſs where he had been, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral waies which had been propoſed by <hi>Knowles</hi> and others, for the Murthering the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Ladys Project, as being the more likely way to ſucceed. To which the Counteſs replyed, It was but a ſilly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, yet, peradventure it might do. However, ſhe gave him no order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thereon as yet. But reſolving, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to make ſure work, they obliged him to charge his Lordſhip with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by making him one of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Peers, whom they intended to charge with a Conſpiracy againſt the Kings Crown, and Life; that ſo if they failed of Murthering him with their hands, they might however deſtroy him with their breath. To which purpoſe, his name was inrolled in that Liſt which was found in the <hi>Meal-Tub,</hi> and gave the firſt light into their Plot, which was more fully diſcovered by <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s miſcarrying in the chief part of their Conſpiracy; <hi>(Viz.)</hi> placing the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Papers in Collonel <hi>Manſe</hi>'s Chamber, whereby all was ſpoiled for that time. And <hi>Dangerfield</hi> being to wait on His Majeſty, to give him an account of this pretended Plot, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93855:78"/>of <hi>P—s</hi> gave him directions to lay all the Burthen he could upon the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> in general, but more eſpecially upon His Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> of <hi>Wark,</hi> Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſcrick,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> and ſome others. And that he ſhould explain to His Majeſty, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Contents of the ſeveral Papers he had preſented to the Duke (who was the perſon that introduced him to His Majeſty, to make this pretended diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) and how the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to uſe their utmoſt endeavours for the reducing the preſent Government, and ſetting up a Common-wealth once more, and ſetling His Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> therein (a likely buſineſs) and that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Honour, were iſſuing out Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions for that purpoſe, and had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome to ſeveral perſons.</p>
               <p>And having hereby ſecured this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign indifferently well, as they thought, and being now come to a Reſolution in what method <hi>Dangerfield</hi> ſhould attempt his Lordſhips Life, they commanded him to repair to <hi>Sharp,</hi> and confeſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, (it being their common cuſtom to make them receive the Sacrament, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93855:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>Introduction to the horrideſt Villanies) and the crafty Prieſt having firſt palliat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Murther, by urging the neceſſity of it, and the extraordinary advantage that would thereby redound to their Cauſe and Party, and ſo covered the Crime with a Mantle of Religion, that he made it appear meritorious. He then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with abundance of Formality, and Jeſuitical Zeal, to Conjure him by all that was good or ſacred, that he ſhould with all poſſible ſpeed ſtab his Lordſhip, ſo ſoon as he ſhould receive order from the Popiſh Lords ſo to do. He promiſed he would, and ſo the impudent Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Villian diſmiſſed him with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of coſtly benedictions and hearty wiſhes for the happy ſucceſs of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes. And a Letter coming for the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> which commanded him to go that very night, and put their Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſtabing his Lordſhip in Execution, he received inſtructions not to enter into any diſcourſe with him, when he had him alone, but after a little Apology for his coming to his Lordſhip without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent, or introduced by any other perſon, and deſiring to know whither, if it ſhould ſall out to be in his power to ſerve him, he ſhould obtain ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93855:79"/>of his Lordſhip, as to find his ſervice acceptable to his work; and then receiving a ſhort <hi>French</hi> Dagger (as he judges it to be) provided for that purpoſe, by the <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> Merchant, he went immediately to <hi>Thannet</hi> Houſe, in <hi>Alderſgate-ſtreet,</hi> where his Lordſhip lived, and found ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance with more eaſe and freedom, than he expected; the Earls Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy rendring him altogether without ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion; But <hi>Dangerfield</hi> finding divers perſons in the Room where his Lordſhip was, and fearing leaſt ſome of them migt know him, and thereby he be diſcovered, he pretended his buſineſs required privacy, and humbly deſired to ſpeak with his Lordſhip alone, whereupon he ſent him with one of his Gentleman up ſtairs, and ſoon after his Lordſhip coming himſelf to know what buſineſs he had with him, <hi>Dangerfield</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated over the ſtory wherein he had been inſtructed, but his Lordſhip not knowing what to make of it, entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome other diſcourſe with him; but <hi>Dangerfield</hi> perceiving ſome perſons to be at the other end of the Room, was ſtruck with a ſuddain horror and ſear of mind, and the dread of being diſcovered was ſo terrible to him, that he was in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93855:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>tormented to be gone, and preſently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his leave return'd, and acquainted thoſe who had employed him, that he had been with his Lordſhip, and there being too many perſons in the Room, be thought it not ſafe to make an attempt upon him at that time; but withal to ſave his Credit, aſſured them the thing was eaſie to be done, and promiſed to do it the next time he went. The next morning early, his Boy went to the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> with a Letter, wherein he gavean Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the Lords, that he had entered himſelf at the Earl of <hi>Shaftsburys,</hi> and promiſed without fail, to diſpatch him within a few days. The Counteſs her ſelf wrote an Anſwer to that Letter, and ordered <hi>Dangerfield</hi> to go to the King, and acquaint His Majeſty that he had been at his Lordſhips to make ſome further diſcovery of the New Plot, and that he ſhould tell His Majeſty <hi>Verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> what he had ſaid to his Lordſhip, and that he had promiſed to get him an employ, and to take care of him. The next morning he went to the King, and repeated his Leſſon accordingly.</p>
               <p>About two or three days after, he was ordered by the Conſpirators to repair to his Lordſhip again, and frame a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93855:80"/>to him, to this or the like Effect: <hi>(Viz.)</hi> My Lord, I am now come with ſomething that very nearly concerns both your Lordſhips Honour and Perſon: for if your Lordſhip ſhould be ſent for before the King and Council, and there have ſeveral Accuſations of High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon brought in againſt you, and you ſhould thereupon be committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and that the Evidence, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe Accuſations, ſhould prove Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written by your Lordſhips own hand, then I hope you will believe I am your faithful Servant. Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived theſe Inſtructions, and the Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he went in the dusk of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a ſecond time to <hi>Thannet</hi> Houſe, where ſending for Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> one of his Lordſhips Gentlemen, to the Door, he acquainted him with his deſire of ſpeaking privately with his Lord. Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> having firſt acquainted his Lordſhip therewith, took him into a Room, which <hi>Dangefield</hi> ſuppoſed to be his Lordſhips Cloſet, deſiring him to ſtay there, and telling him the Earl would come to him preſently.</p>
               <p>But as ſoon as the Gentleman was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, <hi>Dangerfield</hi> began to look about the Room, and found another Door, beſides
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93855:81"/>that at which he came in; and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it lead into the ſame Room where he had been with his Lordſhip before, he concluded, that if the Earl came into the Cloſet, he would immediately have ſtab'd him, having the advantage of two Doors to eſcape by, intending ſo ſoon as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtroak had been given, to put out the Candle, and under the colour of lighting it, make his eſcape. But Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo ordered it, that his Lordſhip came not at all into the Room, but after two hours waiting (which he employed in ſearching many Letters, and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which he found in a Table-Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, putting ſome of them into his Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, which when they came to be perus'd, prov'd to be Letters from Sir <hi>Richard Bulſtrode,</hi> His Majeſties Agent at <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> the Contents whereof imported no more than the then preſent poſture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in that Country) ſent for him into the next, which diſappointment ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded him, that he had no power to proceed in his bloody determinations: but having repeated his Leſſon to his Lordſhip, left him to meditate upon the comuſed and groundleſs ſtory, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with a ſeigned chearfulneſs, which made thoſe that had ſent him fluſh with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93855:81"/>hopes that he had ſucceeded in his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; but when they underſtood the contrary they were extreamly concern'd, having aſſured themſelves of the like ſucceſs that they had found in the Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> was ſent from his Lord to tell him, that of all people, he admired to find him ſo great a Coward: and that however it was his Lordſhips pleaſure to try him once more, ordering him in the mean time to make the moſt of thoſe Letters, by repairing to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and acquainting the King with the Diſcourſe he had with his Lordſhip, and ſhew the Letters of Sir <hi>Richard Bulſtrode,</hi> to His Majeſty, that thereby he might obtain the greater Credit; and leaſt the Earl ſhould have ſuſpected the Intreague, by miſſing of his Letters, and be with the King before him, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make no manner of delay, but repair immediately to His Majeſty; For, ſaid he, if the Earl ſhould be there before you, it may be more prejudicial to you, than perhaps you imagine. He was moreover to tell the King, that a great number of very dangerous Papers relating to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> deſign, were in the Lodging of Collonel <hi>Manſel,</hi> and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93855:82"/>deſired a Warrant to ſeize on them.</p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>Dangerfield</hi> went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to Mr. <hi>Cheffinch,</hi> who had introduced him to His <hi>Majeſty</hi> once before, and was by him placed in a Room which the King was to paſs through; and His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſeeing him there, asked him what he had to ſay to him? he anſwered, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the inſtructions he had received, and humbly prayed a Warrant to ſearch the Collonel's Lodgings; His Majeſty bid him repair to Mr. <hi>Secretary Coventry,</hi> and acquaint him with the buſineſs, who would thereupon grant him a Warrant. Upon this away went <hi>Dangerfield</hi> to the <hi>Secretary,</hi> and having firſt acquainted him with the Story, told him it was His Majeſties pleaſure he ſhould wait on him for a Warrant: Notwithſtanding which the <hi>Secretary</hi> abſolutely refuſed to grant him one, unleſs he would firſt make <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavit,</hi> that there were ſuch Papers in the Collonel's Chamber, and what the Contents of them were. But the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman could do neither: The firſt he could not Swear, becauſe the Papers were not then there, but were to have been conveyed thither after the Warrant was obtained; And the ſecond he was afraid to Swear, leaſt the <hi>Secretary,</hi> who was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93855:82"/>a very wiſe and judicious perſon, ſhould preſently apprehend the Truth, that they were framed and conveyed thither by himſelf, ſince it would have been impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble otherwiſe to have known the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Letters in a Gentlemans Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with whom he had never exchanged two words in his Life; wherefore refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to make <hi>Affidavit,</hi> he was forced to go away without a Warrant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he repaired to the Lord <hi>Peter</hi>—telling him what had happened, and that he had been twice at the Earl of <hi>Shaftsburys.</hi> His Lordſhip ſeemed to be well pleaſed therewith, and promiſed, that when any Forces were raiſed, he would put in for a Regiment of Horſe, and would give him a Troop in the ſame, but withal, bid him be ſure to do the Earls buſineſs the third time. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Counteſs of <hi>Powis</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> were extreamly angry with him for refuſing to make ſuch <hi>Affidavit</hi> as the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary</hi> required, for the obtaining a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: telling him he might ſafely have ſworn, ſince he had formerly ſeen, and been at the Writing of ſome of them, &amp; that at the worſt, it could not be <hi>Perjury,</hi> becauſe the Oath was not made in a Court of Record, perſwading him to make amens
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93855:83"/>for that overſight, by repairing again to <hi>Thannet</hi> Houſe, and there, without any hiſſitation or fear, ſtab the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> He deſired to be excuſed in that Affair, aſſuring her that his two former diſappointments had ſo diſcouraged him, that he could not poſſibly perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ever to make any further attempts in that kind. At which her Ladyſhip ſeeming very much concerned, obraided him with Cowardice, and ſaid ſhe would go her ſelf.—No Madam, replyed Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> that ſhall not be, for I will go and do the buſineſs ſo effectually, that there ſhall be no occaſion for a ſecond attempt, whereby I will convince the World, that ſome of our Sex are braver, and more couragious and daring, than the Men.</p>
               <p>Then the Counteſs asked him if he had learned where Mr. <hi>Manſel</hi>'s Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were? yes, ſaid he, with a great deal of trouble, I have; he Lodgeth at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Why then you timerous perſon, ſaid ſhe, pray take theſe Papers and convey them privately into ſome part of his Chamber, Cloſet, or Trunks. He told her it was impoſſible to do that, in regard he had no manner of knowledg of him. You muſt, ſaid her Ladiſhip, find out ſome way or other to get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93855:83"/>with him, and then you muſt invite him to the Tavern, and Drink ſmartly, whereby you may doubtleſs have an opportunity to Lodge the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in ſome part of his Cloaths, and ſo ſoon as you have done that, you muſt immediately upon pretence that he has ſpoke Treaſon, call for a Conſtable, and get him apprehended, and ſearched, and the Papers carryed to the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and ſo get him committed. <hi>This was to have been the Introduction to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy for deſtroying not only this Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord, whoſe vertue, and firm, and ſtedy cleaving to the Intereſt of His Majeſty, and the Proteſtant Religion, had rendered him the greateſt Object of their hatred and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but likewiſe of all the chief</hi> Engliſh <hi>Proteſtant Nobility and Gentry, who had any way diſcovered their Averſation to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, by endeavouring to have their Helliſh Deſigns againſt the Sacred Life of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the Proteſtant Religion, throughly ſearched into and proſecuted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For upon this he was to have moved the King and Council, to have impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to ſearch the Lodgings and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſeveral other Gentlemen (whither they were to have conveyed the like Treaſonable Papers.) Then ſhe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93855:84"/>him fifteen Letters, and a Liſt of Names, but one of the Letters, and the Liſt of Names, being Written by her own hand, ſhe deſired him to get them Tranſcribed: which he offering to do himſelf, was told by her, that it muſt not be done by him, becauſe they were to be brought before the King and Council, and the King having received from him ſome Remarks, Written with his own hand already, would thereby diſcover the whole to be forged. Wherefore having got a <hi>Scrivener</hi> over-againſt <hi>Sommerſet</hi> Houſe, to Tranſcribe them, he went to <hi>Ax-yard</hi> in <hi>Kings-ſtreet, Weſtminſter,</hi> where inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for Lodgings, he was directed to Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>'s, which was the very Houſe where the Colonel Lodged: and there, under the feigned Name of <hi>Thomas,</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know what Chambers they had to diſpoſe of, and being ſhewed all the Rooms in the Houſe, none would pleaſe him, but the two Rooms up one pair of Stairs; but was told that Colonel <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> Lodged in them, and therefore they could not be diſpoſed of without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which could not then be obtained in regard he was not at home, ſo that he could not effect any thing at that time.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Female <hi>Hero</hi> reſolving
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93855:84"/>to approve her ſelf the Champion of the Popiſh Cauſe, went with a feigned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to his Lordſhip, hoping before her return, to give him a Wound ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more fatal than that which ſhe had formerly given to ſome others of our Sex. But his Lordſhip according to his uſual cuſtom when he Treated with Strangers, kept a ſtrict Eye upon her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time they were diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing together, and perceiving her to be buſily fumbling about her Pockets, he gently laid his hand upon hers, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently drol'd with her concerning the buſineſs ſhe pretended to viſit him about, whereat being very much troubled and diſcouraged, ſhe preſently took leave of his Lordſhip. But being advanced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as far as the Door, and reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſgrace ſhe ſhould bring upon her ſelf, by having promiſed never to return but with the happy News of Victory, and yet accompliſhing as little, or leſs than <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> whoſe Cowardice ſhe had exclaimed againſt with ſo much ſcorn and contempt, ſhe ſuddenly returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Lordſhip, reſolving not to ſtir from the ſpot, until ſhe had laid him at her Foot. But the Earl ſeeing her come back, ſteps to her, and as if guided by the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93855:85"/>direction of ſome ſuperior influence, laid his hand upon hers as before, which ſo daſhed her out of countenance, that ſhe was forced to depart without ſucceſs. Heaven having Decreed that this Illuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Peer, who had been ſo uſeful to the King and Kingdom, ſhould not looſe his Life ſo tamely, and fall a Sacrafice to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Rage; Nor that the <hi>Engliſh Anals</hi> ſhould ever report to ſucceeding Ages, that the great <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was ſlain by the feeble hand of an Impeous Strumpet.</p>
               <p>This diſappointment heightened their Rage, and made them reſolve to haſten the finiſhing of their Plot, not doubting but to involve him in the common ruine of the reſt of the Proteſtant Nobility. Wherefore <hi>Dangerfield</hi> went preſently and took the two Rooms where <hi>Manſel</hi> Lodged, he having conſented to remove one pair of Stairs higher, that ſo he might not hinder the Houſe of ſo benificial a Lodger as he ſeemed to be. And being conducted into the Room where the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel was to Lodge, whilſt his own was put in order, and fitted for him, he laid hold of that opportunity to place thoſe Treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Papers behind the Colonel's Beds-head, and then acquainted the Conſpirators with what he had done, who ordered him to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93855:85"/>go again to the King, and deſire a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to ſearch. Accordingly he went to Mr. <hi>Cheffinch,</hi> and was by him brought to His Majeſty, whom he earneſtly ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a Warrant: but His Majeſty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His accuſtomed wiſdom, ſent him again to <hi>Secretary Coventry,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſs ſuſpicious of him now, than he was before, no Warrant was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from him; wherefore the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators being informed, they reſolved, That having proceeded ſo far, they would not be baffled by one difficulty, wherefore they commanded him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to ſome of the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> Officers, and pretending to inform them where a conſiderable quantity of prohibited goods that had been Imported were, concealed to procure a Warrant to ſearch, which was eaſily granted, and two Officers ſent to ſearch the Houſe: he firſt carryed them to his own Room, for the better colouring the buſineſs, and having ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there and found nothing, he conducted them into the Colonel's Chamber, who was at that time abroad; where they did, upon his aſſurance that the goods were in that Room, make a thorough ſearch, breaking open his Trunks and Boxes, and with the exacteſt ſcrutiny imaginable,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93855:86"/>examined the very Bed-Clothes, but no prohibited goods being to be found, they were about to depart, when <hi>Dangerfield</hi> intimating that probably they might be hid behind the Bed, they preſently remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it about three foot from the Wall, but could find nothing; whereupon <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield</hi> ſtepping forward looked in, and ſeeing the bundle of Papers lying where he had placed them, preſently cryed, <hi>What's that lies there?</hi> whereupon one of the Officers taking it down and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he preſently ſnatched one of the Papers (which was the Liſt of Names, ſome Written at length, and others only the two firſt Letters) and cryed, <hi>Here's Treaſon!</hi> The Searcher opening another, and beginning to read therein, <hi>Dangerfield</hi> cryed out again, <hi>There's Treaſon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in that Paper againſt His Majeſty, wherefore the Papers ought to be all ſeized, and the perſon who owns them, if he were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to be ſecured:</hi> perſwading them to carry the Papers to ſome <hi>Secretary</hi> of State. However, they knowing better what belonged to their own Office, than that of a Juſtice of the Peace, refuſed ſo to do, but carryed them to their own Maſters at the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi> whereof he informed the Conſpirators; who fearing, leaſt by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93855:86"/>that means their Deſign might be ſpoiled, and their hopes fruſtrated, ordered him to go forthwith and tell the King the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how he had cauſed the Papers to be ſeized, which he did, and His Majeſty ſent him to call Mr. <hi>Secretary Coventry,</hi> to give ſome order about it: which done he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and acquainted Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> and the Counteſs, what he had done, and that he had the Honour to be in a Room alone with His Majeſty. Oh! what an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity have you loſt, ſaies one, and how bravely might he have killed the King, ſaies the other, if he had been provided. And yet theſe vile Miſcreants, who could lament <hi>Dangerfields</hi> not perpetrating ſo horrid a Crime, have the impudence to call themſelves Loyaliſts, and are, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their diſloyal Principles and Practices, believed to be ſo, by ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the World, whoſe pretences to Loyalty and the Proteſtant Religion, made people except other things from them.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Harris</hi> being ſurpriſed at the finding Treaſonable Papers in her Houſe, preſently went in ſearch of the Colonel, and having found him, acquainted him with what had happened, perſwading him to take Lodgings in the City, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93855:87"/>promiſed to ſend his things to him, if he would do ſo: but he rejected her advice as pernicious, and proceeding only from a Feminine ſimplicity, and timerouſneſs, ſince his ſo doing would have been cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured as a ſlight, and that would have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued Guilt, and his perſonal Guilt would have involved hundreds of other innocent perſons in the ſame Condemnation. Wherefore being aſſured of his own Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Innocence, he went to the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-Houſe,</hi> to know by what Authority his Box was ſeized, and what was become of thoſe Papers which were pertended to be found in his Chamber, and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That they were all returned to his Lodging again; whereupon getting together the Officers of the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi> the Maſter and Miſtriſs of the Houſe, and what other perſons were preſent at the ſeizure, Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> took their Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and found upon the whole matter, that it was a malicious Deſign to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve a great number of Innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Guilt of Treaſon and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt His Majeſty; whereupon he made out a Warrant for apprehending him, which being delivered to a Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they went along with him to Mrs. <hi>Celliers,</hi> where he then, and the St. <hi>Omers
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93855:87"/>Novices</hi> formerly had Lodged, there the Conſtable and Warrant found him. When he underſtood their buſineſs, he exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt <hi>Manſel,</hi> crying out, <hi>It was his doing,</hi> thinking thereby to ſhuffle off his own Guilt; but it ſhould not do, for he had been that day with the King himſelf, and with Mr. <hi>Secretary Coventry,</hi> and had acquainted them with the buſineſs; <hi>And before he gets home,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>there will be inquiry made for him at his Lodging.</hi> Well, ſaies the Juſtice, your Hectoring will not ſerve your turn, if you will give ſecurity to appear at the <hi>Council-Board,</hi> by Nine of the Clock to Morrow Morning, we will give you no more trouble at this time, but if not, you muſt go to Priſon. Whereupon <hi>Cellier</hi> and her <hi>Son-in-Law,</hi> entered into Recognizance for his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the Council the next day, which he did accordingly; but as ill luck would have it, he unfortunately met with a moſt unhappy and miſchevious accident: for as he was going down the Council Stairs, he met with Mr. <hi>Do'iley</hi> an Officer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Mint,</hi> who knew him, and had formerly proſecuted him for utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſe Guinneys; whereupon being conſcious of his Guilt, and fearing that the Gentleman would undoubtedly have
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93855:88"/>diſcovered it to the King and Council, and thereby have ruined his Credit, and ſpoil the hopeful Deſign he was carrying on. He began without any kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, to Curſe and Damn him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding what he had to ſay to him? and ſwearing, That if he had him out of the Court, he would cut his Crown, and threatned, that when he met him in a convenient place, he would revenge the injury. Whereat <hi>Do'iley</hi> being very much ſurprized, and ſeeing Sir <hi>Francis North, Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> juſt going to the Council, he being one of the Members thereof (and as providence ordered came ſo opportunely, as to hear the words that paſſed between them:) he ſteps to him, and acquaints him with <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Character, and complained of the abuſe he had then received from him; as ſoon as his Lordſhip came into the Council Chamber, he acquainted His Majeſty and the Council therewith, who thereupon ſent Juſtice <hi>Walcup,</hi> and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to take <hi>Do'ley</hi>'s depoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Dangerfield;</hi> ordering moreover a Meſſenger to take him into Cuſtody, which was preſently done, and he was carryed to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Head</hi> Tavern, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Juſtice came to examin him as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93855:88"/>ſoon as the the Council was riſen. But in the mean while he Writ a Note to Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> and ordered her to acquaint the Lord and Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> that he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, for they knew that the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger would not ſuffer the Note to be ſent, until he had firſt read the Contents of it; which having done, the Boy carryed it according to directions.</p>
               <p>The next day Colonel <hi>Manſel</hi> and he, being both called into the Council Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Lord Chancellor demanded of the Colonel, what Correſpondencies theſe were which he held? Here are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, ſaies he, of dangerous Conſequence, importing no leſs than the levying Men, and raiſing Rebellion againſt the King; here is alſo a Catalogue of Names whom you have liſted. The Colonel affirmed he knew nothing either of the Letter or Liſt of Names, nor never did, or ever would hold any Treaſonable Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with any Man living; And humbly prayed the favour of the Court, that he might be permitted, how he came by a ſight of thoſe Papers, aſſuring them that he did not queſtion but to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that thoſe Papers were brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Chamber by <hi>Dangerfield;</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on leave given by the Board, he gave
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93855:89"/>them a full and clear account of the whole Matter, whereupon he was ordered to call in his Witneſſes, which he did. And Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> made Oath, That the Papers then before the Council, were the ſame which were left at his Houſe by Mr. <hi>Sretch,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Boſtock:</hi> who made Oath, That being inform'd by <hi>Dangerfield</hi> of certain prohibited goods concealed in <hi>Ax-yard,</hi> they appointed to meet him at Mrs. <hi>Celliers,</hi> in order to go with him to ſeize them, but when they came there he was not then ready, having not yet lain at his New Lodgings; but told them, that he intended to go to them that very night, and therefore appointed them to come the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following in the Morning, and that when they came there, they found <hi>Dangerfield</hi> in his Chamber, and one <hi>Bedford</hi> with him; and that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> took them aſide, leaſt <hi>Bedford</hi> ſhould hear, and whiſpered to them, that the goods were in the Room above Stairs, and deſired them to charge him to aſſiſt 'em, which they did (and that after a narrow ſearch) finding no ſuch goods as they were informed of, he pointed towards the Bed, whereupon they pulled it away from the Wall, and ſearched very narrowly, but could diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93855:89"/>no goods, nor did the Papers appear to them; whereupon he pointed to the Beds-head, and then Mr. <hi>Stretch</hi> went behind the Bed with a Candle, but could ſee nothing. And that then <hi>Dangerfield</hi> went himſelf behind the Bed, and calling to them, cryed, <hi>What's that hangs there?</hi> pointing to a bundle of Papers, that were pinned to the Beds-head; which they had no ſooner taken down, but he ſnatched one of them out of the Officers hand, and cryed out, <hi>Here's Treaſon!</hi> There was in that Paper, words to this Effect. <hi>I wonder at your delay, and that the four Lords have left us! for now the Tyrant has declared himſelf a Papiſh; (which agreed very well with what they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards endeavoured to charge upon his Lordſhip, and the reſt of the Proteſtant No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility:)</hi> upon the reading of which words, he cryed out, <hi>Did not I tell you theſe were Treaſonable Papers? they ought to be ſecured, and the perſon whoſe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this is, if he were preſent.</hi> They ſwore likewiſe, that the Papers which the Council had then before them, were the ſame which they took down from behind the Beds-head, and that they did verily believe them to be placed there by <hi>Dangerfield.</hi>

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:93855:90"/>
The Council proceeding no further in the examination of the Plot that day, the Juſtice took Bail for <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> till the next day; And then the Colonel Petitioning that the reſt of his Witneſſes might be heard, His Majeſty Adjourn'd the Examination thereof till the next Council day, in regard of ſome other buſineſs which the Council had then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, whereupon <hi>Dangerfield</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that till then he might be Bailed, but His Majeſty refuſed to grant it, and ordered in Council, that he ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Cuſtody by the Meſſenger: who acquainting <hi>Dangerfield</hi> therewith, he ſtormed, and ſaid, He was confident there was no ſuch order, for he knew there were thoſe perſons that would not ſuffer him to be ſo Treated: but the Meſſenger inſiſting upon his order, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Sword, which he very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly delivered, and ſo was conducted to the Meſſengers Houſe. He had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to move the Board, that the Colonel might be committed likewiſe, but my Lord Chancellor oppoſed the motion, and ſo it fell.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>Monday</hi> following, they being both called into Council, and <hi>Dangerfield</hi> having by that time received inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93855:90"/>from the Conſpirators, how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in it, Addreſſed himſelf to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, affirming there were in all ſixteen Papers, deſiring to know what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the reſt which was before the Council, and what was become of the Box of Treaſonable Papers, and two or three hundred Letters. Adding, That <hi>Manſel</hi> had got together a company of Witneſſes to diſparage the Kings Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and to palliate his Treaſonable Practices, and deſiring leave to ask him ſome queſtions, which being granted, he asked him, if he did not frequent a Club in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Market? whether he did not know one <hi>Diſney Liſle, Engliſh Grange,</hi> and <hi>Brown?</hi> whether he did not bring into the Club a Pamphlet, called, <hi>A Word without Doors,</hi> and read it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to the Club? whether he did not after the reading thereof, utter Seditious Words again His Royal Highneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manſel</hi> replyed, He knew many of the Gentlemen he had named, that they were very honeſt Gentlemen, and good Subjects, and that all of them lived in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> except Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> who had been Lieutenant to Major <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Troop of Horſe, in His Royal Highneſſes Regiment. But for all Treaſonable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93855:91"/>with them, or any other perſons, he utterly diſowned, and was thereupon commanded to call the reſt of his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who appearing, proved that there were no more Papers taken in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than what was before the Council; And Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> who lay with <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> the night before the pretended diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and was to have been an Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in the management of the Plot, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Council, That after the ſearching the Colonels Chamber, and ſeizing the Papers there, he went to Mrs. <hi>Celliers,</hi> and told <hi>Dangerfield</hi> what an ill thing he had done, both in injuring Mr. <hi>Manſel,</hi> and likewiſe by ingaging him in ſo baſe and vile a buſineſs, deſiring him therefore to diſcover and lay open the whole contrivance, and who it was that put him upon it; And that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> replyed, He did not doubt but to come off well enough, ſince ſo great perſons had ingaged him in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>D'oiley</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that he had proſecuted him at two ſeveral Seſſions, held in the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> for uttering falſe Guinneys; to which <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield</hi> replyed, He was indeed twice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted upon that account, but it was out of pure malice: And that for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, he had received His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93855:91"/>Gracious Pardon: wherefore he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thoſe Matters would not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred againſt him now, to the prejudice of his Evidence. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, who had ſollicited His Majeſty for his Pardon? he anſwered, Captain <hi>Richardſon;</hi> then his Boy Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed that he had Lodged at <hi>Powis</hi>'s Houſe, and had been ſeveral times at the Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Lodgings at the <hi>Tower:</hi> That he had ſeveral times ſent him with Letters and other Papers, to the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> and that he had brought him back Anſwers: That the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> had been ſeveral times at Mrs. <hi>Celliers,</hi> during the time that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> Lodged there, and particularly on the <hi>Saturday</hi> was ſeven night before, when ſhe was alone with him in a Room, in private diſcourſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an hour. Then the Lord Chancellor asked him whether he had ever been with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury?</hi> to which he replyed, He had been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times with his Lordſhip, and had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with him, repeating ſome of thoſe things which had paſſed between them. You are in the mean time, ſaies the Chancellor, a fine Fellow, to come firſt to the King, then to the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> and from thence to the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burys,</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:93855:92"/>and diſcover to one, what diſcourſe you had with the other, and go with one Story to the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and bring another to the Council; And indeed the buſineſs appeared ſo plain to the Board, that they committed him to <hi>Newgate,</hi> by the following Warrant.</p>

               <p>ANd now the wickedneſs which had hitherto hovered in the Dark Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes, began to be more and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: for Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> Houſe being ſearched, the whole Scheam of their Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies was found hid in a Tub of Meal, they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93855:92"/>having aſſured themſelves that none would be ſo ſcrutinous as to to ſearch there: whereupon ſhe was apprehended, and being examined concerning Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> ſhe ſaid ſhe had entertained him upon no other account than to get in deſperate Debts. However, being ſent to the <hi>Gate-Houſe,</hi> ſhe preſently diſpatcht away a Paper to him, telling him, That now her Life lay in his hands, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed him to confirm what ſhe had ſaid; That he was taken into her Houſe only to get in bad Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſending him withal Twenty Shillings in Silver, and a Guinney and two Books of Account, that ſo he might Conover, and be perfect in his Leſſon. But taking Caution by the unfortunate Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> he reſolved not to throw away his Life as he had done, nor patiently conſent to be Hanged, to pleaſe the Conſpirators. Wherefore he made a full diſcovery of the whole Matter, upon Oath before Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> then Lord Mayor of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> whereupon Sir <hi>Robert</hi> repaired to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and gave an account thereof to His Majeſty, who preſently ſent it to the Council, and <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by order of Council brought before them, and was further examined by their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93855:93"/>Lordſhips, who thereupon committed the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> to the <hi>Tower,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi> to the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Regaut,</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and the Counteſs and others, into the Cuſtody of His Majeſties Meſſengers: and the whole Deſign was at ſeveral times unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably proved before them, by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably concurring Circumſtances, and ſubſtantial Evidences, and the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors themſelves confeſt the greateſt part of it to be true. But yet hoping to make the beſt of it, and turn it off to the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and the reſt of the Proteſtants, whoſe ruin they thirſted for: their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>Gadbury,</hi> pretended to make ſome great diſcovery, in caſe His Majeſty would grant him his Pardon, which he Graciouſly promiſed to do. But his Lordſhip hearing thereof, and ſuſpecting that thoſe who had endeavoured to ruin him by a Plot, to charge him with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and had failed of accompliſhing it, that way would not ſcruple at attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to attain their end, by falſe and feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſcoveries thereof: deſired that no Pardon might paſs the Seal for <hi>Gadbury,</hi> until he had firſt been heard in Council, whereby he wiſely prevented that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which was ſuppoſed to be deſigned
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93855:93"/>againſt his Lordſhip, by that <hi>Jeſuited Star-gazing Caballiſtical Whiffler.</hi> That which confirmed moſt men in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that he had ſome deſign againſt the Earl, was this, That although he did ſhortly after receive the King's Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pardon, yet no diſcovery made by him was ever heard of to this day.</p>
               <p>But theſe things were ſcarce over when another deſign to murther him is diſcovered by <hi>Franciſco de Feria,</hi> who depoſed at the Bar of the Houſe of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> that being prefered to be Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter and Secretary of <hi>Languages,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Gaſper, Abrew de Freitas</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in Ordinary from the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> to the King of <hi>England.</hi> The Ambaſſador perſwaded him to kill the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> by throwing a hand-Granado into his Coach, which he ſaid was eaſie to be done, when his Lordſhip was travelling upon the Road into the Country, which he did often.</p>
               <p>What an heroick and magnanimous Soul muſt he then be maſter of, that could ſo bravely bare up againſt all thoſe boiſterous Storms and continual Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts which were perpetually raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him by the art and malice of the <hi>Popiſh Crew.</hi> And that notwithſtanding
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93855:94"/>thoſe innumerable difficulties and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers wherewith he was always ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which ſtill threatned his ruine, the ſimple conſideration of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Loyalty was able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an undiſturbed quiet, and a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Serenity within him.</p>
               <p>But however theſe frequent diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments inraged, yet it did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them from further Attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Life and Honour; but rather added to their fury, and encreaſed their deſire of revenge. The next endeavour therefore to prove that he the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> had aſſiſted <hi>Oates, Tongue,</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> in contriving the <hi>Popiſh Plot.</hi> To which purpoſe they corrupted Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> and prevailed with him to write a treaſonable Letter to <hi>Oates,</hi> and then cauſe the Doctor's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to be ſearched and rummaged, in hope to find it there, and ſo to prove him to be a Confederate with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and other <hi>Proteſtant Nobles.</hi> But the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſent the Letter to Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon,</hi> then Secretary of State, and thereby ſpoiled that Deſign, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſent one <hi>Lewis</hi> to his Lordſhip, to deſire he would ſend by him the ſaid <hi>Lewis</hi> ſome Directions to Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93855:94"/>his Lordſhip's own hand-writing, how he ſhould manage himſelf in reference to the Plot; but the Earl abſolutely denied to have any thing to do therewith: And having failed in this Project, they next procured young <hi>Tongue,</hi> Son to Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> to prove that his Father, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and <hi>Oates,</hi> invented the <hi>Popiſh Plot;</hi> Whereupon one of the Lords of the <hi>Council</hi> asked him, If they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters too? To which he could make no reply; and indeed the whole buſineſs was ſo weak and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that it effected nothing more than the depreſſing the <hi>Wretch</hi> that was to have been the Evidence of it under the weight of his own Guilt, he being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> where he hath ever ſince remained.</p>
               <p>Beſides their publick Deſigns, they had ſeveral ſecret Projects and Artifices to accompliſh his Ruine; As forging of his Hand, and other ſuch like baſe and villanous Arts, as appears by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepting Letters directed to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and after having incerted Treaſon in them, in a hand as near the Original as they could poſſibly counterfeit, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to ſuch hands as would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly acquaint our Miniſters of State
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93855:95"/>therewith, but more eſpecially a certain Gentleman who had commanded a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Horſe in the Service of his late Majeſty, for whoſe ſake, and his preſent Majeſtie's, he ſuffered the loſs of all that he had, writ to the Earl about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving him againſt the Gout with which he was much afflicted, whoſe Letter was intercepted (the perſon that writ it, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at that time in the <hi>Frengch King's</hi> Dominions) and after they had added to it an account that the Writer was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to furniſh the Earl with Forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men from <hi>France,</hi> to oppoſe the <hi>D.

               <p>His Majeſty having prorogued the Parliament, his Lordſhip together with the Earls of <hi>Huntington, Clare, Stamford, &amp;c.</hi> the Lords <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Grey, Chando's, Grey, Howard,</hi> and <hi>Herbert,</hi> being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to his Majeſtie's Preſence, by his Highneſs Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> preſented the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Petition and Advice to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>

                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:93855:98"/>and obſerving from Hiſtories and Records, how unfortunate many ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies have been, when called at a place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Capital City; as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Congreſs in <hi>Henry</hi> the Seconds time at <hi>Clarendon:</hi> Three ſeveral Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the Thirds time; and at <hi>Coventry,</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixths time, with divers others, which have proved very fatal to thoſe Kings, and have been followed with great miſchief to the whole Kingdom.

                        <p>And the Lord Chancellor, in purſuance of Your Majeſties Commands, having more at large demonſtrated the ſaid dangers to be as great as we, in the midſt of our fears, could imagine them; and ſo preſſing, that our Liberties, Religion, Lives, and the whole Kingdom, would certainly be loſt, if a ſpeedy proviſion was not made againſt them.</p>

                           <pb n="92" facs="tcp:93855:99"/>
And Your Majeſty on the <hi>21ſt.</hi> of <hi>April, 1679.</hi> having called unto Your Council ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Honourable and Worthy Perſons, and Declared to them, and to the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, That being ſenſible of the Evil Effects of a ſingle Miniſtry, or private Advice, or forreign Committee, for the general Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Your Affairs, Your Majeſty would for the future refer all things unto that Council, and by the conſtant Advice of them, together with the frequent uſe of Your great Council the Parliament, Your Majeſty was hereafter reſolved to govern the Kingdom: We began to hope we ſhould ſee an end of our Miſeries.</p>
                        <p>But, to our unſpeakable grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, we ſoon found our expectations fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the Parliament then ſubſiſting was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued, and Diſſolved, before it could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what was intended for our relief and ſecurity: And tho' another was thereupon called, yet by many Prorogations it was put off till the <hi>21ſt.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> paſt; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Your Majeſty was then again pleaſed to acknowledge, that neither your Perſon, nor your Kingdom, could be ſafe, till the Matter of the Plot was gone through: It was unexpectedly Prorogued on the <hi>10th.</hi> of this Month, before any ſufficient Order could be taken therein: All their juſt and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93855:99"/>pious endeavours to ſave the Nation were overthrown, the good Bills they had been induſtriouſly preparing to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Proteſtant Subjects brought to nought: The diſcovery of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plots ſtifled: The Witneſſes that came in frequently more fully to Declare that, both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> diſcouraged. Thoſe forreign King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and States, who by a happy Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with us, might give a check to the <hi>French</hi> Powers, diſheartned, even to ſuch a deſpair of their own ſecurity againſt the growing greatneſs of that <hi>Monarch;</hi> as we fear may enduce them to take New Reſolutions, and perhaps ſuch as may be fatal to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s: the Strength and Courage of our Enemies, both at home and abroad encreaſed, and our ſelves left in the utmoſt danger of ſeeing our Country brought into utter deſolation.</p>
                        <p>In theſe extremities we had nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God to comfort us, but the hopes that Your Majeſty (being touched with the groans of your periſhing People) would have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Your Parliament to meet at the day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which it was Prorogued, and that no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interruption ſhould have been given to their proceedings, in order to their ſaving of the Nation: But that failed us too, ſo then we heard that Your Majeſty had been prevailed with to Diſſolve it, and to call
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93855:100"/>another to meet at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where neither Lords nor Commons can be in ſafety, but will be dayly expoſed to the Swords of the Papiſts, and their Adherents, of whom too many are crept into Your Majeſties Guards. The Liberty of ſpeaking according to their Conſciences will be thereby deſtroyed, and the validity of all their Acts and Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (conſiſting in it) left diſputable. The ſtraitneſs of the place no way admits of ſuch a concourſe of perſons as now follows every Parliament: The Witneſſes which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give Evidence againſt the Popiſh Lords; ſuch Judges, or others, whom the Commons have impeached, or had reſolved to impeach, can neither bear the charge of going thither, nor truſt themſelves under the Protection of a Parliament, that is it ſelf evidently under the power of Guards and Souldiers.</p>
                        <p>The Premiſes conſidered, We Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Petitioners, out of a juſt abhorrence of ſuch a dangerous and pernicious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, (which the Authors have not dared to avow) and the direful apprehenſions of the calamities, and miſeries that may enſue thereupon; do make it our moſt humble Prayer and Advice, that the Parliament may not ſit at a place where

               <p>BUt His Majeſty reſolving not to alter His Reſolution for the Parliaments ſetting at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the time of their metting drawing near, the Members from all parts repaired thither, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93855:101"/>themſelves in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expoſed in a place ſo remote from <hi>London,</hi> to the Inſolency of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> upon the account of that Vigilency and Courage, wherewith they had proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Popiſh Plot in former, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they appeared there with a Guard, ſome of them, being accompanied thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their Tenants and Neighbours; ſome by the Freeholders by whom they were choſen, and many of them only by their own Domiſticks; And to ſay the Truth, the whole number was ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that it ſerved rather for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than Strength, and could have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded but little aſſiſtance, if the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> had made an aſſault upon them, as was feared. Going thus attended to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, holden at places remote from the Royal City, hath alwaies been uſual and cuſtomary, and accounted not only honeſt, but deſent and honourable too, eſpecially in times of difficulty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when not only a Suſpition, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Evidence, and undeniable Proof of a deſign to deſtroy the King, murther His Subjects, and ſubvert the Government, renders it fooliſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to do otherwiſe, leaſt thereby the innocent and unwary, expoſe themſelves
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93855:101"/>to the inſolence and fury of their ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Adverſaries. But notwithſtanding this antient and laudable Cuſtom, it was looked upon at this time as an ill thing, and great improvement made thereof towards the effecting what had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo often unſucceſsfully attempted, as will appear by the ſequel of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
               <p>The King having made preparations for His Journey to <hi>Oxford,</hi> went firſt to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and from thence to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, being met upon the Border of the County, by the High Sherift and his Attendance, and at <hi>Wbateby</hi> by the Lord <hi>Norris,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of the County, with a great Train of Gentry, and the two Troops of the County Militia, who conducted him to the Eaſt-Gate of the City, where he was received by the Mayor, and the reſt of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and welcomed by the Recorder, in an elegant and florid Oration; Then the Mayor preſented him with the Mace &amp; Sword, which being return'd again, the Mayor attended with the Aldermen and Recorder, carried the Mace before His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to <hi>Chriſt Colledge-Gate,</hi> from whence the King paſſing to His Lodgings, which were prepared for him in the <hi>Colledge,</hi> was
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93855:102"/>received by the Biſhop, and welcomed in a <hi>Latin</hi> Speech which he made on his Knees. And the next morning His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was attended by the Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, the Orator, and the reſt of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers belonging to the Univerſity; The Orator making a Speech to the King in <hi>Latin,</hi> and to the Queen in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Lordſhip and divers other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, imitated thoſe of other parts, and went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> accompanied likewiſe with ſeveral perſons of their Neighbours and Acquaintance, who Innocently of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to wait on them ſome part of the way, and others, throughout to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 21ſt. the Parliament met at the <hi>Convocation Houſe;</hi> The King told them he had not parted with His laſt <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> had it not been for their unwarrantable proceedings; he commended to them the proſecution of the Plot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Having ended his Speech, the Commons returned to their Houſe to chuſe themſelves a Speaker, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly made choice of Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> who had been Speaker of the former Parliament; the choiſe being over, they preſented him to His Majeſty, and the Speaker Addreſſing himſelf to the King, acquainted Him, That the Commons
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93855:102"/>according to His Majeſties command, had proceeded to chooſe them a Speaker, and to ſhew that they were not given to change, they had choſen him; and that he did according to their command, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate himſelf at His Majeſties Feet to receive his pleaſure, with a Head and Heart full of Loyalty to His Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Armed with a ſettled Reſolution, never to depart from His antient and well ſettled Government. The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving approved of the choice, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for Speaker, the Commons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and repaired to their own Houſe, and ſettled Elections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On the <hi>25th.</hi> they entered upon the conſideration of the Matter relating to the Bill, which had paſſed both Houſes in the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for repeal of the Act of the <hi>35th.</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but was not tendred to His Majeſty for the Royal Aſſent; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that a Meſſenger ſhould be ſent to the Lords, to deſire a Conference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>Another Meſſage was alſo ordered to be ſent to the Lords, to put them in mind that they had formerly by their Speaker demanded judgment of High Treaſon at their Bar, againſt the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and therefore deſired them to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93855:103"/>appoint a day to give judgment againſt him upon their Impeachment.</p>
               <p>The Impeachment of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was next entered upon, in order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto his Examination being-read in the Houſe, they ordered it to be Printed, and that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> ſhould be impeached at the Lords Bar, and a Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to draw up Articles againſt him. The Houſe ordered Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> to carry up the Impeachment to the Lords, which he at firſt refuſed; but perceiving the Commons were ready to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for that Contempt, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and went up and impeached <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> at the Bar of the Lords Houſe, in the Name of the Commons and People of <hi>England.</hi> The Impeachment of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> being thus delivered to the Lords, they rejected it, whereupon his Lordſhip and Eighteen Peers, entered their Proe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation againſt their throwing of it out; The Commons likewiſe Voted it to be illegal, and the next Morning <hi>March, 28th.</hi> His Majeſty ſent for them into the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> and told them that their beginnings had been ſuch, that he could expect no good of this Parliament, and therefore thought fit to Diſſolve them, and accordingly the Chancellor by the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93855:103"/>Kings Command, Declared the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Diſſolv'd.</p>
               <p>By this unexpected and ſuddain Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, a final concluſion was put to all their Debates, and all their further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of, and proſecuting the Popiſh Plot, was terminated by a full Point.</p>
               <p>The Parliament being thus Diſſolv'd, the King took Coach immediately, and departed to <hi>Windſor</hi> the ſame day, and after a few hoursſtay, returned to <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> and the Earl likewiſe returned to <hi>London;</hi> having firſt left as a mark of his magnificence and bounty, a piece of Plate to <hi>Baliol Colledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this Parliament we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Active part of his Lordſhips Life, for about that time the Scene alter'd and he becomes only paſſive in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his Life, in relating the Storms whereof I am fallen into ſuch a Laborinth of Plots, Sham-Plots, miſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Intreagues, Subornations, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and confident Affirmations of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Impoſſibilities, as no Age ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, or Hiſtory can parallel, ſo that it cannot be expected I ſhould Write an exact Hiſtory thereof; but the Reader muſt be content to let it remain as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the Myſtery of Iniquity,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93855:104"/>until ſuch time as he to whom all things are open and naked, ſhall bleſs the World with a full and clear diſcovery of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. But as a commical Prologue to the intended Tragedy, a company of <hi>Obſcure Varlets, Iriſh Bogtrotters, Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennels,</hi> and <hi>Indigent Extravagants,</hi> who having profuſely waſted their own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, would gladly imbrace any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to repair them by the ruine of others; and treated each other with no leſs than the aſſurances of vaſt and mighty Fortunes, and being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to places of Profit and Honour: And ſome of them in a bravary, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite others to an imitation of them in their wicked Practices, chinks their Guinneys, and expoſes their Golden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, affirming that ſo ſhould be done to the Man who was beloved; with other encouragements and invitations to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and allure them to come over and labour at the work of Tranſubſtantiating the Plot. And indeed to ſuch a heigth of Ambition and vain Glory they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved over, that they commonly diſcourſed of being advanced to Captains and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns Places, Deanries and Prebendaries, and putting a mighty value upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſcorned to think of leſs than great
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93855:104"/>Preferments, and as much Mony as they would demand.</p>
               <p>Not long after the Diſſolution of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament, one <hi>Brian Hans</hi> came to his Lordſhips, pretending to be ſome Gentleman of Quality, and that he could make very conſiderable diſcoveries of the Popiſh Plot, and the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmond bury Godfrey,</hi> and deſired his Lordſhip in order thereunto to procure him a blank Pardon, being very unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he pretended, to have his Name known, until he had his Pardon procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him. The Earl, who was alwaies ready to ſerve His Majeſty and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Intereſt; and ſuppoſing that this could be no inconſiderable Peach of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to diſcover the Murther of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Knight more fully than had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done, which muſt neceſſarily give a greater light into the Plot, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to get him one, but it could not be obtained. And not long after this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Gentleman of Quality dwindled into a mean and obſcure Wretch, and of a pretended Evidence of the real Popiſh Plot, degenerated into a bluſtering Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a fictious Proteſtant one; For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended, and carried before the Council, inſtead of diſcovering any thing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93855:105"/>about the Death of Sir <hi>Edmondbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> he accuſed his Lordſhip and others of having endeavoured to ſuborn him to do it. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Rouſe,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had been ſome time employed by Sir <hi>Thomas Player,</hi> in paying off the Army which had been Disbanded not long before; and Mr. <hi>College,</hi> who had attended ſome of the Parliament Men to <hi>Oxford.</hi> And <hi>Saturday, July</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> 1681. in the Morning his Lordſhip was apprehended by a Meſſenger, by Vertue of a Warrant from the Council, and his Papers all ſeized and carried to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where the King likewiſe arrived from <hi>Windſor,</hi> about Ten of the Clock; and then he was examined before His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and the Council, ſome of the Judges likewiſe were preſent. His Lordſhip knowing himſelf clear of what was laid to his charge, boldly affirmed, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly proteſted his Innocency, adding as it was reported, That were he Guilty of thoſe Crimes whereof he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he was certainly a mad-Man, and had thereby rendered himſelf more fit for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> than the <hi>Tower,</hi> whither up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sequel he was committed cloſe Priſoner for High Treaſon, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither by Water, in a <hi>Barge;</hi> and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93855:105"/>the King returned the ſame day to <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</hi> And now the better to prepare peoples minds to believe what he was to be charged withal, the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Prieſts</hi> in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Popiſh Crew, privately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed divers Helliſh and Lying Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, wherein they maliciouſly aſperſed him with Conſpiring Treaſon againſt His Majeſty; one whereof which was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more impudent and miſchievous than the reſt, and was called, <hi>Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Earl of Shaftsbury,</hi> was diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſome privacy and caution.

                  <item>

                  <item>
                     <hi>III.</hi> That He endeavoured to Levy War

                  <item>
                     <hi>IV.</hi> That he endeavoured to render the <hi>Church of England</hi> as Rediculous as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and Defam'd all His Majeſties Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers both by Land and Sea; and all others, who out of a due ſenfe of Loyalty adhere to the Crown ſtiling them <hi>Tories, Tantivies, Maſqueraders,</hi> &amp;c. purpoſely to frighten them from their Duty, and wean them from their Soveraign, to adhere to Him and His Faction.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>V.</hi> That He countenanc'd, harbour'd, and hired perſons to Swear againſt the <hi>Queen,</hi> and His <hi>Royal Highneſs.</hi>

                  <item>
                     <hi>VI.</hi> That He procured ſeveral Sums of Mony to be Raiſed ond Collected to carry on theſe moſt abominable Deſigns.</item>

               <p>And to repreſent him as monſtrouſly unnatural and bloody as themſelves, and render him hateful and deteſtable to all Men, who would be ſo Brainleſs, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſilly and rediculous Shams; the Articler adds in the cloſe of his <hi>Libel,</hi> this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93855:106"/>ſtrange and improbable <hi>Rodemantado:</hi> that when the Sergeant at Arms appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him, he deſired him to eat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before he appeared before the King and Council; whereupon ſaies the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller,</hi> his Lordſhip anſwered, <hi>I have no Stomach to eat, unleſs I could get a Roaſted</hi> Iriſh-Man.</p>
               <p>The Seſſions of the Peace for <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> beginning on the <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> following, he preſented a Petition to the Court, deſiring to be brought to a ſpeedy Tryal, or elſe admitted to Bail. Upon the <hi>8th. Stephen Colledge</hi> had an Indictment preſented againſt him to the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> who were all of them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Men; And after having heard all that could be ſaid on both ſides, they returned an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon the Bill, but being removed to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and tryed there, was found Guilty, and was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Condemned and Executed; and a forged Paper preſented and publiſhed by one <hi>Thompſon</hi> a <hi>Printer,</hi> and ſuppoſed to be Writ by ſome <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> who are alwaies ſo good at inventing of Shams, called, <hi>His laſt Speech,</hi> wherein he was made to confeſs all that he was charged with, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it afterwards appeared that he abſolutely denied he was any way
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93855:107"/>Guilty, affirming his Innocency to the laſt Breath. <hi>Auguſt 31ſt.</hi> his Lordſhip preſented another Petition to the Judges at the Seſſions at the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> deſiring that he might be either Tried or Bailed, purſuant to the Act of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> to which the Court returned anſwer, That being charged with no Crime in that Court, and being Priſoners in the <hi>Tower,</hi> they could take no Cognizance of them, but they muſt ſeek their relief at the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Bar the next Term; great preparations were made for his Tryal, and abundance of Witneſſes procured, and Mr. <hi>Samuel Wilſon,</hi> a Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Lordſhip, was likewiſe committed to Priſon, for ſpeaking ſome Treaſonable words as was ſworn by ſome of thoſe Evidences. Now you muſt know this <hi>Wilſon</hi> was the Gentleman whom his Lordſhip intruſted to attend the Council when his Papers were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over, and take away thoſe which were returned, and indorce the reſt with his own Name; and that the Paper ſaid to be found in the Earls Cloſet, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting an Aſſoſiation, was not indorced by him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, notwithſtanding they had abundance of Witneſſes, yet
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93855:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>they deſired to have ſome, whoſe port and figure in the World might procure them the greater Credit, and thereby render them the more capable of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing their end in the Earls ruine; And as they imagined, Fortune offered them the moſt likely and favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that could poſſibly be deſired or wiſhed for, by the following accident. Captain <hi>Henry Wilkinſon,</hi> a Gentleman that had alwaies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Royal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and had hazarded his Life, and impared his Eſtate in the ſervice of his Prince; having a deſire to ſettle in the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Carolina,</hi> applied himſelf to the Proprietors for an employment in that Country, and had upon the account of his Loyalty to His Majeſty, a promiſe made him of being employed as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour under the Proprietors by his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, who was one of the chief Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and to whom upon the account of his great judgment and diſcretion, the reſt had committed the whole manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Captain having obtained this promiſe, hired two Ships to convey himſelf and Family, and what other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were to go with him thither, whereof one of them was a Relation of mine. Upon this one <hi>Booth,</hi> a perſon well Born, but by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93855:108"/>his wicked and proſligate Life, had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his Patrimony, loſt all his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and rendered himſelf very indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and neceſſitous, applied himſelf to the Captain, deſired to go with him to <hi>Carolina;</hi> and withal perfiked a time for coming on Board, and engaged to bring with him about ſixteen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or upwards. This was eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, but not ſo eaſily performed: Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Companions enough he might have had, who had like himſelf, reduced themſelves to Poverty and Diſtreſs, and would for that reaſon, have been glad of ſuch an opportunity of being freed from the Scorn and Contempt of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and the Dread of a Goal; But how to pay for their paſſage, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them when they came there, he knew no more than the Man in the Moon. But after a little conſideration, he reſolved of the following adventure to ſupply that difficulty; He firſt forged Letters, as directed to him from perſons of Quality, deſiring him to buy them ſeveral Rich Goods of <hi>Mercers, Drapers, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholſterers,</hi> &amp;c. and then he went with thoſe Letters to ſome Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with whom he had for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe procured ſome kind of acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93855:108"/>ſhews them the Letters, tells them if they would uſe him well, he would buy the Goods of them; you ſhall, ſaies he, have your Mony as ſoon as I have acquainted the perſons that I have bought the Goods, and can receive and anſwer from them again. After this manner he went to Mr. <hi>Halford</hi> a <hi>Mercer</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> with a pretended Letter from the Lady <hi>Ogle,</hi> now Dutches of <hi>Summerſet;</hi> wherein he was ordered to buy her ſeveral curious flowred Silks, and other Rich Goods, to the value of between Two and Three Hundred Pounds, that Mr. <hi>Halford</hi> might give the better Credit to the buſineſs, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Gentlemans Brother to go with him. And for your Brothers ſake Sir, ſaid he, I have a very great kindneſs for you, and would rather you ſhould take my Mony, than any other Man; adding, That he expected ſhortly to be Steward to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and then he would endeavour to procure him the Cuſtom of that Family; But ſuppoſing the Shop to be too publick, and therefore not ſafe enough to treat in, he invited him to the <hi>Kings-Arms Tavern,</hi> and there diſcourſed the buſineſs. I have not all the Goods you mention, in my Shop, ſaies
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93855:109"/>
                  <hi>Halford,</hi> but in a day or two, I can get them, pray do, ſaies he. You may be ſure, <hi>Halford</hi> imagining he had gotten a brave Cuſtomer, applied himſelf with double diligence to procure the Goods againſt the time appointed; but the Merchant he bought them of knowing they were Goods he did not uſually deal in, eſpecially ſuch quantities, he asked him who they were for? whereupon <hi>Halford</hi> told him the whole Story; you had beſt have a care you are not cheated, ſaies he, I do not like the buſineſs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may do as you find occaſion. At the time appointed he came to ſee the Goods, and liked them very well, and intended they ſhould have been the cheapeſt that ever he bought. But <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> being thus cautioned, told him the Goods came to a great deal of Mony, that he was a young beginner, and could not conveniently truſt him for them, but if he would pay him ready Mony, he would to oblige him, ſell him cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than he ſhould buy at any other Shop. Sir, ſaid <hi>Booth,</hi> I am content, I will come and ſetch the Goods, and pay you ready Mony, but never came near him more. After the ſame manner he went to Mr. <hi>John Ridges</hi> an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholſterer,</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:93855:109"/>who lives in St. <hi>James</hi>'s, near St. <hi>James</hi>'s Houſe, and hath a Shop likewiſe in <hi>Long-Lane</hi> in the City, but came off with the like ſucceſs. My deſign of brevity will not permit me to mention all his tricks of this Nature, nor how he ſerved the <hi>Taylor</hi> in <hi>Field-Lane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe diſappointments rendered him unable to perform his promiſe to the Captain, and wholly diverted his thoughts from <hi>Carolina,</hi> accounting it a vain thing to go thither, being thus unhappyly diſappointed of his <hi>Cargo:</hi> And the Captain being ſo diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him and others of his paſſengers, and having had two Shipslye ſo long at his own charges to attend them, had thereby Contracted ſome Debts, for which he was Arreſted, and his Ship and Goods ſeized on; when he was firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted he was ſent to the <hi>Counter,</hi> but quickly after removed himſelf to the <hi>Kings-Bench.</hi> This accident created new thoughts in <hi>Booth</hi>'s working Brain, and put him upon a New Project for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of his broken Fortunes, and the making himſelf amends for his late diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments. The Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> committed the other day to the <hi>Tower</hi> for High Treaſon, and <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> who
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93855:110"/>was upon his commendation to have gon Deputy Governour of <hi>Carolina,</hi> in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> for Debt; And can I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to get no advantage thereby? Yes, in ſpight of <hi>Fate,</hi> and <hi>Maugre</hi> all the Powers of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> I will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, I will ſet up for an Evidence my ſelf, and will ſo mannage the matter, that I will procure him to be one too: his poverty and loſs, and the ſorrows of a Goal, will undoubtedly diſpoſe him to a compliance with my motion. But therein the mercenary wretch reckoned without his Hoaſts, and found himſelf wofully deceived in the idle immaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that every Mans Conſcience was as much viciated and depraved as his own, and would adventure upon the moſt vile and abominable practices whatſoever, in hope thereby to free themſelves from thoſe pinching neceſſities which they were involved in, and by failing in that enterprize, learned the true difference between being impoveriſhed by the want of ſucceſs in Trade or Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and the being undone by Profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Debauchery.</p>
               <p>Before he adventured to Addreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Captain about the buſineſs, he ſent others to brake the Matter to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93855:110"/>him, relating the particular Circumſtan, ces the Captain was at that time under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and inſtructing them how to behave themſelves towards him. Being thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, <hi>October 8th.</hi> 1681. <hi>Bains</hi> viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Captain in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> where after ſome Complements and Preparitary Diſcourſe, to make way for, and diſpoſe the Captain to comply with what he had to oſſer, he proceeded to tell him that he muſt needs know ſomething of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Deſign againſt the King, and perſwading him to diſcover it to him; and promiſed if he would do ſo, he would procure him a Pardon, and a great Reward: The Captain anſwered, He knew nothing by his Lordſhip but that he was a very Loyal Perſon. So ſoon as he was gone, the Captain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted Major <hi>James</hi> with what <hi>Bains</hi> had offered, and the Major preſently took his Pen and Ink, and wrote it down in his Pocket Book. Two or Three days after, <hi>Booth</hi> adventured to try his own Fortune, and that he might prove more ſucceſsful than his fore-runner, procured leave for the Captain to go out of the Priſon to <hi>Booth</hi>'s Lodging, at Mr. <hi>Waver</hi>'s in the <hi>Rules,</hi> where they entertained him with a Noble and Splendid Treat: and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93855:111"/>aſſured him, if he would be an Evidence againſt the Earl, he ſhould have 500 <hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr> per. ann.</hi> ſettled upon him and his Heirs, as a Reward, or if he liked a 1000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> in ready Mony better, he ſhould have ſo much paid him down; and finding him ſtill untractable, they perſwaded his Wife to uſe her Intereſt with him, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prevail with him, and work him to a compliance with what they deſired, telling her ſhe might thereby be made for ever. But when all this, and many other contrivancies failed them, they gave in an Information of High Treaſon againſt him to the King and Council, by whoſe order he was brought before them, and ſtraitly examined concerning what he knew of a Plot againſt the King, and to have ſeized on His Perſon at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> The Captain perſiſted in his own Innocency, and affirmed he knew no ſuch thing by the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Then <hi>Booth</hi> ſwore High Treaſon againſt him, and depoſed that <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> was to have been Captain of a Troop of Horſe conſiſting of Fifty Men, which were to be employed in ſeizing the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> when the Parliament ſat there: and to gain the greater Credit to his Oath, and make the thing more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93855:111"/>he affirmed himſelf was Liſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as one of them; although to my knowledge, and the knowledge of many more, The Getleman at that very time when the Parliament met at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and this was pretended to be done, was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily employed in the aforeſaid Affair of providing for his Voyage to <hi>Carolina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Captain upon this Depoſition, was committed back again to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Priſon, where he acquainted the Major with what had paſſed at the Council, and he Writ that down likewiſe as he had done the reſt; and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain willing to expoſe the Villany, and prevent the miſchief of his mercinary Breath, publiſhed an account of the whole Matter to the World, to which I refer the Reader for further ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhip having continued in the <hi>Tower</hi> from <hi>July,</hi> till the latter end of <hi>November,</hi> without obtaing a Tryal, His Majeſty then iſſued out a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> to be held at the <hi>Old-Bayly</hi> on the <hi>24th.</hi> of that Month, when an Indictment of High Treaſon againſt his Lordſhip was preferred to the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> ſummoned upon that occaſion which was the moſt ſubſtantial of any that had been known for a long time
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93855:112"/>before. The Court being ſet, and the Jury ſworn, the Witneſſes gave in the like Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Court as they had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done to the Council. They generally ſwore much to the ſame purpoſes, and <hi>Booth</hi> was one of the chief Evidences; who declared upon Oath, that the Earl told him, That he and others had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with themſelves, it was neceſſary for them to have Guards at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and that he had for that reaſon provided Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Gentlemen, and had intruſted Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> with the command and management of them; that he himſelf was Liſted as one of them, (yet could name none of the reſt) and that he had thereupon bought himſelf a very good Stone-horſe, with other Accoutrements for the ſaid Service; And that Captain <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> promiſed to furniſh his Man with a Horſe. Now, that the World may the better judge of the truth or falſeneſs of what this Man ſwore in the face of ſo great an Aſſembly, and from thence argue the validity of the other Evidences, I have tranſcribed <hi>Verbatim</hi> an Advertiſement, which was thereupon publiſhed the next Week in <hi>Janeway</hi>'s <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,</hi> Number 65.</p>

Alſo the ſaid Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> made Oath, that he had bought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a good Stone-horſe, and other Accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the ſaid Service, and Captain <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> was to furniſh his Man with a Horſe.</p>
                     <p>This is therefore to give Notice, That if any one can make it appear, that Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> bought any ſuch Horſe, with his Marks and Colour, and who he bought him of about <hi>March</hi> laſt, or that he had any ſuch Horſe within that time, and what Stable he was kept at, ſhall have upon good proof made thereof to the ſaid Captain <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> Five Guinneys paid him for a Reward of his pains.</p>

               <p>IT's worthy of every Mans conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that this was not delayed till the thing was worn out of mind, but Publiſhed whilſt it was yet hot and freſh in every Mans Memory; And that therefore if any ſuch Horſe had been bought and kept by <hi>Booth,</hi> either the perſon who ſold him, or thoſe who were preſent at the buying of him, or the <hi>Inn-Keeper</hi> where he ſtood, or the <hi>Oſtler</hi> that looked to him, or ſome one or other who muſt undoubtedly have ſeen him Ride, or at leaſt the perſon to whom he afterwards ſold him, would certainly either out of a Principle of Love and Loyalty to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, to detect the impudence of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93855:113"/>Captain, in Publiſhing this Declaration to vindicate the Honour and Reputation of <hi>Booth,</hi> to deſpite the Earl and render him the more Guilty, or elſe out of Love and Deſire of the Five Guinneys, have appeared and given Evidence thereof. The ſame may be ſaid of the Captain's Horſe, and therefore it muſt be granted, that neither the one nor the other had any Horſe at all: and if ſo, how improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Story it is, That the Captain ſhould command a Troop of Horſe, when at that ſame time he had not a Horſe to Ride on, nor never had been in 20 years, at the place where this Troop was to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And yet upon the Evidence of this Man and others of the like temper, fome Men would have had his Lordſhip found Guilty, and Convicted of no leſs Crime than High Treaſon, railing againſt, and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> for doing otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>After a full hearing of all that the Witneſſes had to ſay, the <hi>Jury,</hi> thought themſelves obliged to return an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon the Bill, which occaſioned a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral joy and ſatisfaction, as plainly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the many Bone-fires which were that Night made almoſt in every Street, and at ſeveral Country Towns, upon hearing the News thereof.</p>

The Earl being thus cleared by the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> moved to be diſcharged, but could not obtain it, till 13 of <hi>Feb.</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then both he and ſeveral others who were Priſoners upon the account of this imaginary Plot were releaſed; And having thus gained his Liberty ſhe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted ſeveral perſons, whereof ſome of them were Evidences againſt him, in an Action of <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> and one <hi>Cradock</hi> and others, in an Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> but was not able to bring any of them to a Tryal. For on the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> being the firſt day of the Term, <hi>Cradock,</hi> whoſe Tryal was expected to be brought on firſt, moved by his Council, that the Tryal might not be in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Middleſex,</hi> but in ſome other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; upon which motion the Court or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, That on the <hi>Fryday</hi> following, the Earl ſhould ſhew cauſe, why it ſhould not be Tryed in another Country. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly his Lordſhip appeared in Court himſelf, and Declared it was his deſire to have it Tryed by an indifferent <hi>Jury,</hi> but only deſired to have it Tryed that Term by a <hi>Middleſex Jury;</hi> aſſerting, That an indifferent <hi>Jury</hi> might as well be had there, as in any Country in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> On the <hi>12th.</hi> the like motion was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93855:114"/>made in the behalf of <hi>Graham</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Lordſhip finding he could not have it tryed in <hi>London,</hi> and not willing it ſhould be tryed in any other County, in regard an Addreſs of Abhorrence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a certain Paper ſaid to be found in his Lordſhips Cloſet, importing an Aſſociation was preferr'd in moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; declared, That ſince he could not have the undoubted Priviledge of a Peer, to lay his Action in any County in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he would remit it at preſent, and wait till he had a better opportunity to revive it.</p>
               <p>After this, his Lordſhip continued at his houſe in <hi>Alderſgate-ſtreet</hi> until the <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>November</hi> following, and then he went over to <hi>Holland:</hi> The Seas were ſomewhat Tempeſtuous, and ſome who went over in company with the ſame Ship were caſt away; but the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God ordered That to ſave his life, which is often the loſs of others; <hi>viz.</hi> An unskilful Pilot, who being not well acquainted with the Haven, and withal ſomewhat timerous, would not be perſwaded to venture in till he had a calmer Sea. As ſoon as he arrived, and was known, he was viſited by ſome of the States and others of the greateſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93855:115"/>Quality, who welcomed him into that Country, and Congratulated his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo happily eſcaped the danger of the Seas.</p>
               <p>The Earl not long after his Arrival, took a ſpacious Houſe in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where he intended to reſide; he was to pay for it a yearly Rent of an Hundred and fifty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> but before the Houſe was furniſhed and fitted for his uſe, his uſual Deſtemper, the Gout, ſeized him, and handled him with great violence for ſomedays, and then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to wear away, and the Earl was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently recovered, but ſuddenly and unexpectedly returning again, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into his Stomach, he fell into a dangerous Relapſe, which proved mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and terminated in his Death. He diſcovered in the time of his Sickneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of patience, and an admirable temper of mind, yielding an intire ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Divine Will, and ſolacing his Soul in the Contemplation of that Tranſcending Glory and Happineſs whereinto he was paſſing, and wherein he ſhould for ever remain free from the Malice of ambitious and aſpiring Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, and ſecure from the fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the poyſonous and infectious
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93855:115"/>Breaths, of all mereinary Villains. He expired in the Arms of a Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and will certainly prove as great and as univerſal a Loſs as has happened to <hi>England</hi> in many years.</p>
               <p>He died at <hi>Amſterdam, January</hi> 21. 1682. Or rather like the faireſt Fruit, which being ripened by Nature, and arrived at its perfect Maturity, falls of its own accord. So this Nobleman being arrived at a full Age, was with the more facility and eaſe ſhaken down by Death, and glided into the Grave without compulſion in the Sixty ſecond year of his Age; during the time of his Sickneſs, he was frequently viſited by ſeveral Perſons of Quality, and ſome Lords of the States, and others who did not viſit him in perſon, ſent often to ſee him, and enquire of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and when he was dead, many of the States, and divers other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men put themſelves into Mourning, and ordered that his Corps ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all Toll, Fees, and Cuſtoms in every place it ſhould be carried tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row within their Dominions, in order to its paſſage to <hi>England:</hi> His Body was firſt wrapp'd in Sear-cloath, and then in Lead, all but his Head and Face, whereon he
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93855:116"/>had nothing, ſave one of the Perrywigs he uſed to wear in his Life-time, and in that manner he was laid in a rich Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin, in the ſtead whereof, juſt over the Earl's Face was placed a Cryſtal Glaſs, whereby every one that pleaſed might view his Face; which to the admiration of all that ſaw it, appeared as freſh and beautiful as when he was living; nor was there any conſiderable alteration to be diſcerned therein. The Ship which Tranſported him to <hi>England,</hi> was hung with Mourning, and adorned with mournful Streamers and Eſcuchions, and being Landed at <hi>Pool</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> the Gentlemen of the County, to ſhew the extraordinary reſpect they had to his Lordſhip, and although they were not invited, yet they got together and went in a body to meet the Corps, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd it to his ancient Seat at <hi>Wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn</hi> St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s, where he was decently and honourably Interred, and will have a ſtately Monument erected over him.</p>
               <p>He made his Counteſs, Sir <hi>William Cooper, &amp;c.</hi> Executors of his Will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he gave very liberally to his Grand-Son the Lord <hi>Aſhley,</hi> and Intailed the whole Eſtate upon him after the death of his Son the preſent Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:93855:116"/>And as he had formerly been the making of ſeveral of his Servants and others by his Liberality, ſo he was no leſs bountiful at his Death, having left very conſiderable Legacies to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, eſpecially thoſe who were with him in <hi>Holland;</hi> beſides ſeveral Gifts to pious and charitable uſes.</p>
               <p>And having thus traced this Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from the Cradle through all the Labyrinths and Viciſſitudes of his Life, to the Hour of his Death, and from thence to his Envied Grave. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Tract with his Character; a Character ſo extraordinary and rare, that it will certainly deſerve, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtly command the Admiration of all men.</p>

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93855:117"/>afraid of being ſupplanted by him. His Head was wiſhed on the Secretarie's Shoulders, and his Life valued by ſome at an higher Rate than the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> though a Lady incomparably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in both the Gifts of Mind and Body.</p>
               <p>Authors are perplex'd under what <hi>Tophick</hi> to place him, whether of States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Sea-man, Souldier, Chymiſt, or Chronologer; for in all theſe he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, he could make every thing he read or heard his own, and his own he could eaſily improve to the greateſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. He ſeemed to be Born to that onely which he went about, ſo dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous was he in all his Undertakings in Court, Camp, by Sea, by Land, with Sword, and with Pen.</p>
               <p>The Earls perſon was ſomewhat ſmall but very comely, God and Nature ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſtributed in the framing thereof an exact agreeableneſs, and an equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to every Part and Member. But as the ſmalleſt Cabinets uſually incloſe the Richeſt Jewels, ſo his little Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93855:118"/>a great and vaſtly Capatious Soul; the Virtues and Perfections whereof as far tranſcended the generallity of the offspring of <hi>Adam,</hi> as Gold exceeds Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or Diamonds tranſcends Pebles in value; He had a couragious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Mind, a deep Judgment, and a quick and ready Apprehenſion; he was Religious towards God, Loyal to his Prince, True to his Country, Faithful to his Friends, Charitable to his Enemies, Liberal to the Poor, Chaſte in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and made the keeping of his Solemn Contracts in Marriage, Sacred and Inviolable, and the preſerving his Chaſte Soul free from Polution, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of his Religion. He was Courteous and Affable in his Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all Men, Sociable and Free in his Converſe; yet ſo wonderfully reſerved as to any of his great Deſigns and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that he never revealed his Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the neareſt Relations, or the moſt intimate Friends, which made him ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary uſefull to His Majeſty in the late Times, and rendered him capable of ordering and diſpoſing all publick Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Councils, ſo that they naturally
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93855:118"/>tended towards his Reſtoration. 'Twas his cloſe and reſerv'd temper, that render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the penetrating into his Sentiments and Intentions, a work ſo intricate and perplexing, that the greateſt diligence of the many Spies who had their Eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fix'd upon, and perpetually watched and pried into his Actions, were not able to effect it; and made it a Task too hard and difficult, even for <hi>Cromwel</hi> himſelf to perform. It was that which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered thoſe who undertook it unable to prove him Guilty of a Plot, wherein he was really engaged, and was a principal promoter and contriver thereof; <hi>(Viz.)</hi> The riſing of Sir <hi>George Booth.</hi> And this cloſe and reſerved temper, ſtrongly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues his Innocency in the late charge of Treaſon; for can any Man in his right Senſes imagine, that the Earl who had till now been ſo reſerved and private in all his Deſigns, even to near Relations, noble Perſonages, and familiar Friends; ſhould all on a ſuddain, relinquiſh his conſtant and avowed Practice, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf into a perfect Changeling, by freely diſcovering that he deſigned no leſs than Rebelling againſt his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93855:119"/>The levying Men, the forming of an Army, and depoſing the King, and thereby put himſelf into the Power, and expoſe his Life and Honour to the mercy of Six or Eight needy and mercinary Fellows? That he ſhould do ſo, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very improbable, if we reflect upon the temper of the Earl, and the condition of the Men who pretended to ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with him, and inſight into his Deſigns; unleſs we can ſuppoſe that the longer he lived, the more fooliſh he grew: or that the more experience he had of the endeavours of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to effect his Ruine, by fixing the Guilt of Treaſon upon him, the more careful he would be to furniſh them with Witneſſes, to prove and make good their Charge. He was ſuch a Proficient in Wiſdom and Policy, that he ſeem'd like a Second <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon:</hi> and ſo clear an underſtanding of the Myſteries both of Law and Divinity, that he could eaſily, and with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, reſolve the moſt difficulty <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and diſcuſs the greateſt Myſteries and Critical Nicities thereof. Which made Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sailsbury,</hi> who held an intimate Correſpondence
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93855:119"/>with him, delight in his Converſe, and value his acquaintance at a high rate; And ſo did Sir <hi>Matthew Hailes,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi> and many more, both Lawyers and Divines, who had the happineſs to be acquainted with him. And occaſioned His Majeſty, as it is ſaid, upon the being informed of his deſiding a very difficult Caſe when he was Chancellor, to affirm, as in a Rapture, That he had a Chancellor, who was Maſter of more Law than all His Judges, and was poſſeſſed of more Divinity, than all his Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Nor was he leſs skilled in the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Trade and Merchandiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he projected and accompliſhed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral great things, as well for the benefit of others and the good of the Publick, as the enriching of himſelf.</p>
               <p>But in nothing did he more excell, than in the ſteddineſs aad evenneſs of his Temper, not valuing or exalting himſelf upon the account of Court Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments or popular Applauſe. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a conſiderable Agent in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93855:120"/>His Majeſties Reſtoration, he aſſiſted in Conducting Him back from his Baniſhment to the Poſſeſſion of his Crown and Kingdom. And as a Reward of his Loyalty, was highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the Opinion, and Dignified with the Favour of his Soveraign: And his Temples deſervedly Incircled with a flouriſhing Coronet by the Hand of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; By whom he was raiſed to the very Top and Pinacle of Honour, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Higheſt Seat of Juſtice, and Enrich'd with a Power to diſtribute Judgment and Equity to the Nation: Glories enough to have Dazl'd a Soul leſs ſteady than his, and ſwell'd it with Pride and Arrogancy; Whilſt he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the ſeveral Steps to Honour, and mounted to the Higheſt Seat of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with a becoming Gravity, and an admirable Compoſedneſs, and Equality of Mind.</p>
               <p>Nor did all that Sublimity and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure wherewith he was Inviron'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get any kind of Haughtineſs in him, or make him Treat thoſe with Scorn and Contempt that moved in a lower Sphere.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93855:120"/>For you might have ſeen him when Shining in the very Meridion of his Glory, and arrived at the Achme of Power and Authority, with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Humility and Condeſcention, ſtop to Reſerve the Complaint of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Supplicant, and with an unwearied Diligence, patiently hearing the Cauſe of the Pooreſt, and do them Juſtice, and Relieve them when Oppreſſed, as ſoon, and with as much Pleaſure as he would the Rich and the Honourable.</p>
               <p>But that which is yet more Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Aſtoniſhing, He deſcended from the height of Glory with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Unconcernedneſs, and laid down the Enſigns of his Grandure with a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Countenance, whereby he ſuffered an Eclipſe of his Honour, without any Diminution of his Brightneſs, and the diveſting him of his Enſigns, deprived him not of one ſingle Ray of his Luſtre; but with the Heart of an Ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> he diſmounted the Curul without the leaſt Diſturbance or Regret, and diſcovered them; and in his late Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments, and the Reproaches and
